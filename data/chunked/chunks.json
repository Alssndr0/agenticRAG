  "Based on the results disclosed and in the Company's business plan, the Executive Officers have reinforced payment capacity in relation to the financial commitments assumed.\nFitch Ratings assigns a Long-Term National Rating to ENGIE Brasil Energia of 'AAA(bra)' with a stable outlook and on the global scale, 'BB(bra)', also with a stable outlook and one notch above sovereign rating. The ratings feed through directly  to  the  ability  to  raise  attractive  credit  lines,  thus  enhancing  competitiveness  in  the  development  of  new projects.",
  "The Company uses lines of credit from top-ranking financial institutions to cover any short- and medium-term cash needs.\nAs concerns the Company's investment projects, in addition to using some of its cash generation, the main source of financing is the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), either directly or through Banks that lend-on BNDES lines. In addition to the BNDES, the Company also uses other development banks such as Banco da Amazônia (BASA) and Banco do Nordeste (BNB). These institutions normally offer interest rates and terms of payment compatible with the return on energy generation projects.\nIf the investment project is not eligible for BNDES financing or due to financing-cost issues, the Company may use other  sources  of  incentivized  funding  such  as  the  Constitutional  Financing  Fund  for  the  Northeast  (FNE),  the Constitutional Financing for the Center-West (FCO), the capital markets through the issuance of promissory notes and/or debentures or other sources of funding, in order to maintain an adequate capital structure and liquidity. The Company constantly evaluates operations financing alternatives.\nIn 2023, the Company used resources from the BNDES and resources arising from the issuance of debentures.\nIn 2022, the Company used resources from the BNDES and BASA as its principal source of financing.",
  "Notwithstanding the fact that Management does not foresee any liquidity deficiency, the Company holds standby credit lines (working capital, long-term financing and bank guarantees) from first class financial institutions.\nIn the event that it should need to draw on financing for working capital, the Company intends as a priority to use credit lines available in the market from first class credit institutions. In the case of financing of non-current assets, the Company intends as a priority to use long-term financing resources directly from the BNDES or its Lend-On Banks.\nIn addition, because of the high rating assigned by ratings agency Fitch Ratings, the Company has ready access to the capital markets should it need to obtain additional funding.",

  "The  Company's  compensation  policy  is  to  maintain  compensation  in  line  with  market  practices,  meeting  the interests of the Company and its employees. Therefore, the company considers the following aspects:\n· The amount paid to each employee for his or her work in the Company shall be consistent with the market value of such work according to the compensation strategy adopted by the Company;\n· Compensation should reflect each employee's responsibilities, performance level and results achieved, both individually and as a member of a team.",
  "In  addition  to  the  fixed  salary  paid,  the  Company  maintains  a  variable  compensation  system  based  on  the attainment of business objectives and the percentage attainment of goals associated therewith. This is measured annually based on the Company's financial results and the evaluation of the performance of each of the Company's areas. As such, variable compensation is made up of:\n· Profit- or IncomeSharing Program (PLR): extended to all of the Company's employees and contingent on business results as measured by the fiscal year's EBITDA, in addition to attainment of departmental goals. These criteria are negotiated with workers' uni ons and established in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (ACT). Payment of the PLR fosters competitive compensation compared with those typical of the Brazilian jobs market.\n· Management Bonus Program: applicable to all employees with managerial duties. The program is pegged to attainment of business goals and is contingent on percentage attainment thereof.\nThe Management's proposal considers an amount of up to R$ 40,18 million in employee PLR for fiscal year 2023, to  be  distributed  according  to  the  criteria  set  forth  in  the  Company's  Compensation  System  and  Collective Bargaining Agreements.",

  "The  Company  does  not  have  a  share-based  incentives  program  for  non-management  employees.  However, without burden and not linked to the results, Company employees may participate in the program established by the Controlling Group - ENGIE.",
