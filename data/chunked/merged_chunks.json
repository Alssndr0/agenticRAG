  "Centrais Elétricas do Sul do Brasil S.A. (Eletrosul) was created in 1968 as the third regional subsidiary of Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras), then a state-owned company supplying energy to the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (its area of activity was expanded in 1980, with the inclusion of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul). Eletrosul and the other Eletrobras companies were included in the National Privatization Program (PND), through Decree No. 1,481, of May 3, 1995. On December 23, 1997, Eletrosul was partly split: electricity generation assets were transferred to a new company named 'Centrais Geradoras do Sul do Brasil S.A.' (Gerasul). The assets transferred to Gerasul, at the time of the split, amounted to around 70% of the spunoff net assets.\nAfter the 1997 split, Eletrosul remained exclusively responsible for electricity transmission activities and Gerasul began  to  operate  exclusively  in  electricity  generation  and  sale,  and  both  companies  were  controlled  by Eletrobras.\nIn January 1998, the controlling interest in Gerasul passed to Eletrobras Geração S.A. (Eletroger), a company that originated in the partial spin-off of Eletrobras' assets. In April of the same year, Eletroger incorporated its Gerasul subsidiary and started using the corporate name previously used by the merged company.\nOn May 28, 1998, the Company, as defined below, was registered as a publicly held company with Brazil's Securities and Exchange Commission - CVM under no. 1732-9.\nIn an auction held on the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange on September 15, 1998, ENGIE Brasil Participações Ltda. (current name of GDF SUEZ Energy Latin America Participações Ltda.), which now belongs to the ENGIE Economic Group (new name of GDF SUEZ), acquired the controlling interest in Gerasul, represented at the time by 227,095,639,468 common shares corresponding to 50.01% of Gerasul's voting share capital, for which it paid R$946 million (historical value).\nIn February 2002, Gerasul changed its corporate name to 'Tractebel Energia S.A.'\nThe Company has participated in B3's Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) portfolio since it was first listed on the Novo Mercado segment, in 2005.\nIn July 2016, its corporate name was changed to ENGIE Brasil Energia S.A. ('ENGIE' or 'Company'), so as to use the same name as its controlling economic group in Europe, which was changed from GDF SUEZ to ENGIE S.A. As a result of this change, the Company's shares started trading on B3 under its new trading name 'ENGIE BRASIL', and its 'EGIE3' ticker replaced the former 'TBLE3' ticker. In the U.S. over-the-counter market, the ticker was renamed 'EGIEY'.\nIn order to speed the transition to a carbon neutral economy by encouraging its customers to decarbonize, ENGIE has  become  an  investment  platform  for  energy  infrastructure,  thus  diversifying  its  business  and  prioritizing growth through renewable energy generation sources.\nThe  Company's  diversification  began  to  materialize  more  significantly  when  it  successfully  bid  for  Lot  1  of Transmission  Auction  No.  02  on  December  15,  2017,  held  by  Brazil's  National  Electricity  Agency  (Aneel), including  the  construction,  assembly,  operation  and  maintenance  of  approximately  1,000  kilometers  of transmission facilities and five substations in the State of Paraná (PR) for a 30-year concession period.\n1\nAnother important step was taken as from January 2018, when the Company began trading energy in order to take market positions related to varying electricity prices, within pre-determined risk and counterparty limits.",
  "Activities were further expanded in April 2019, when ENGIE, together with another ENGIE S.A. subsidiary and the Canadian fund 'Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec' (CDPQ), won the bidding process on the sale of Brazil's  largest  natural  gas  carrier,  'Transportadora  Associada  de  Gás  S.A.'  -  TAG  ('TAG').  TAG  operates approximately 4,500 km of high-pressure gas pipelines across 10 states in the North, Northeast and Southeast of the country, with firm contracted capacity to supply more than 70 million m 3  of gas daily.\nWith TAG, the Company consolidated its position as an investment platform for energy infrastructure, in line with its proposal to diversify its operations.\nIn addition to this move, another important step, in March 2020, was the acquisition of Novo Estado Energia, holder of the concession for construction, operation and maintenance of 1,800 kilometers of power transmission lines in the states of Pará and Tocantins.\nSince 2015, in line with the Group's business strategy, ENGIE Brasil Energia has been directing its activities towards  the  generation  of  renewable  energy,  transportation  of  natural  gas,  and  electricity  transmission infrastructure. In October 2021, it completed the sale of Jorge Lacerda Thermoelectric Complex, which accounts for some 75% of the Company's greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn  February  2022,  continuing  its  decarbonization  process,  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  acquired  the  Paracatu  and Floresta  photovoltaic  complexes.  This  process  required  the  setup  of  an  Independent  Special  Committee  for Related-Party Transactions, which, after due assessment, recommended the acquisition of these assets in its report to the Company's Board of Directors.\nIn September 2022, the Company took another important step towards total decarbonization of its portfolio by selling the Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Power Plant, the last coal-fired power generation asset in its portfolio, thus advancing  its  strategy  of  generating  100%  of  its  energy  from  renewable  sources.  The  sale  transaction  was concluded on May 31, 2023.\nOn November 6, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved its 11 th  issue of simple debentures for funding being partly incentivized and partly institutional debentures. The funds raised by the Issuer through the incentivized debentures will be allocated to pay future expenses or reimburse costs, expenses or debts related to projects that may materialize within 24 (twenty-four) months as from the closing of the Offer. Meanwhile, Issuer's proceeds from institutional debentures will be used as working capital to finance the Company's business plan execution.\nOn December 28, 2023, ENGIE Brasil Energia's Board of Directors approved the sale of TAG shares held by the Company - amounting to 15% of the company's total share capital - to Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec (CDPQ).  The  transaction  was  completed  on  January  10,  2024,  after  fulfilling  precedent  conditions,  so  the Company has become direct holder of TAG shares representing 17.5% of its total share capital, while ENGIE Group continued to hold 50 % of TAG's total share capital, both related to the latter's shareholders' agreement, maintaining the current controlling group. This move was an adjustment to ENGIE's strategic positioning to redirect  its  focus  towards  electricity  sector  activities  by  investing  in  generation  and  transmission  -  its  core business -, as a great opportunity to simultaneously rotate assets and generate additional value through new projects, while not putting pressure on its leverage, ratings and payout .",
  "On  November  16,  2005,  the  Company  joined  the  Novo  Mercado  listing  segment  of  B3  (current  name  of BM&FBOVESPA),  which  trades  shares  issued  by  companies  that  voluntarily  commit  to  adopt  corporate governance practices in addition to those required by the applicable legislation. In December of the same year, the Company held a secondary offering of 71 million shares to boost its share value and liquidity in compliance with Novo Mercado requirements.\nNovo Mercado regulations were revised in October 2017 with further requirements for companies wishing to trade in this segment, which are fully met by the Company as of the date of this Reference Form. As the main aspect related to the new requirements, the 202 nd  BoD meeting on May 14, 2020 has set up a Statutory Audit Committee  as  an  advisory  structure  to  help  the  Board  of  Directors  assess  the  financial  statements,  risk management, ethical topics, internal controls, compliance, and internal and external audits. This Statutory Audit Committee consists of three members, two of whom are members of the Board of Directors unrelated to the parent company (therefore, independent). 1998 - 15/09, Events = • Acquired Gerasul through auction (3,719 MW of installed capacity).. 1999, Events = • Started operating William Arjona Thermoelectric Power Plant (80 MW) - diesel oil.. 2000, Events = • Started operating Itá Hydroelectric Power Plant (1,450 MW).  • Signed 1 st  contract for sale of energy to free-contracting environment consumers.. 2001, Events = • Operation of William Arjona Thermoelectric Power Plant using natural gas (120 MW).. 2002, Events = • Started operating Machadinho Hydroelectric Power Plant (1,140 MW).  • Started operating Cana Brava Hydroelectric Power Plant (450 MW).  • William Arjona Thermoelectric Power Plant added 70 MW to total 190 MW.  •  Company named Tractebel Energia S.A. from then on.. 2003, Events = • Started operating Lages Cogeneration Unit with wood biomass (28 MW and 25 t/h of steam).. 2004, Events = • Seven plants certified under NBR ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards.  • Consolidated its market share in the free-contracting environment with sales of more than 700  average MW.. 2005, Events = • Novo Mercado of Bovespa.  • ENGIE Brasil Energia was included in the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of BM&FBovespa  (currently called 'B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão'), in its first version.  • Sold 200 average MW in the 1 st  new energy auction (Itá and Machadinho hydroelectric power  plants).  • Sold 150 average MW in the 2 nd  existing energy auction.. 2006, Events = • Certified six more plants for NBR ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards, thus covering all 13 of its  plants at the time.  • ENGIE Brasil Energia remained in the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of BM&FBovespa  (currently called 'B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão').",

This figure was 2.09% higher than in 2022, when the total generated was 42.779GWh (4,883 average MW), excluding generation from Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Plant due to its sale in May 2023.\nOf this total, hydroelectric power plants accounted for 37,171 GWh (4,243 average MW), which was 1.80% higher than the previous year. The increased generation is due to unfavorable hydrological conditions in 2022.\nFor plants classified as complementary, 2023's energy production of 6,492 GWh (741 average MW) was 3.73% higher than the previous year.",
  "The Company's total energy generation in the year ended December 31 2022, was 43,913 GWh (5,013 average MW), which was 15.82 % higher than in 2021 (37,916 GWh - 4,328 average MW).\nOf this total, hydroelectric power plants accounted for 36,513 GWh (4,168 average MW), 34.0% higher than the previous year. This additional generation reflected higher levels seen as of April 2022, especially in May and June.\nThermoelectric plants produced 1,134 GWh (129 average MW), 78.4% lower than the previous year.\nPlants classified as complementary produced a total of 6,266 GWh (715 average MW) in 2022, 15.81% higher than the same period of 2021, mainly due to the entry into full commercial operation of the Campo Largo II Wind Complex, which accounted for 1,562 GWh (178 average MW), an amount 57% higher than in 2021. Solar energy also  contributed  to  higher  production  from  complementary  sources,  mainly  at  the  Paracatu  and  Floresta photovoltaic complexes, which were added to the portfolio at the end of the first quarter of 2022.\nNote that the Company's additional hydroelectric generation does not necessarily improve its economic and financial performance. Likewise, a reduction in this type of generation does not necessarily imply a deterioration in its economic and financial performance. This is due to the application of the Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE), which shares the hydrological risks inherent to hydroelectric generation among its participants. In relation to the Company's thermoelectric generation, a reduction may increase (due to the Company's contracting levels) increase exposure to the Difference Settlement Price (PLD), while the opposite is also true, with other variables remaining unchanged.",

  "Fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Internal   Availability = 92.6%. Fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Full Availability   (Internal + External) = 90.8%. Fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Internal   Availability = 92.5%. Fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Full Availability   (Internal + External) = 91.0% In the fiscal year end December 31, 2023, Internal Availability, which only considers internal occurrences at the plants, was 92.6% for the entire group of the Company's plants, being 93.7% in hydroelectric power plants, and 87.8% in complementary source power plants.\nTotal Availability, which also considers occurrences taking place outside the plants, was 90.8%, of which 92.1% in hydroelectric power plants, and 84.6% in complementary source power plants.\nCompared  to  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  there  was  a  1.5%  reduction  in  global  availability, reflecting 1.5% and 0.8% lower availability of hydroelectric power plants and those using complementary sources respectively. The Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Plant was not included for comparative purposes since it was sold in May 2023.\nLower availability of hydroelectric and complementary plants was mainly due to modernization works at the HPPs Jaguara and Miranda, in addition to corrective maintenance works in Campo Largo and Umburanas wind turbines.\nAdditionally, ENGIE Brasil Energia reported high levels of operating performance at its Gralha Azul and Novo Estado  transmission  assets  in  2023,  when  total  availability  was  100%.  For  the  12  months  of  2023,  global availability was 99.95%. Deployment of these transmission assets was completed in February 2023, when the remaining transmission lines and substations started operating.",
  "In 2022, Internal Availability, which considers just the plants' internal occurrences, was 92.5% for all Company's plants as a whole, of which 95.20% for hydroelectric power plants, 48.3% in Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Plant, and 88.4% in plants using complementary sources.\nTotal  Availability,  which  also  considers  occurrences  outside  plants,  reached  91.0%,  of  which  93.4%  in hydroelectric power plants, 48.2% in Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Plant, and 88.4% in plants using complementary sources.\nComparing 2022 with the previous year, there was a slight increase of 0.1 p.p. in global availability reflecting a 0.3 p.p. increase in hydroelectric power plants' availability, and 0.8 p.p. in those using complementary sources, while Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Plant showed a 4.0 p.p. reduction.\nIncreased availability of hydroelectric and complementary plants was mainly due to the high rate of HPPs Jaguara and Usina Cogeração Lages, respectively, which were undergoing maintenance in 2021.\nTPP Pampa Sul's reduced level was affected by unavailability due to maintenance works carried out to take advantage of the period in which there was lower demand for its thermal generation dispatch, due to high availability of water resources in the System.\na.4) Information about the Company's generation processes\na.4.1) Hydroelectric Generation\nElectricity  generation  from  hydroelectric  power  plants  is  the  most  used  generation  method  in  Brazil,  being associated with river flows, amounts of water available in a given period and the height of its fall. The larger the volume, speed of the water and height of its fall, the larger its potential use for generating electricity.\nHydroelectric energy is considered a clean renewable source, since water drives turbines and then returns to riverbeds without suffering any type of degradation.",
  "Thermal plants are characterized by producing electricity from thermal energy released from chemical or nuclear reactions.  Thermal  electricity  is  produced  by  a  turbine-driven  generator,  which  in  turn,  depending  on  its configuration, may be driven directly by gases arising from burning fuel, or even by steam produced from a water boiler that is heated by chemical or nuclear reactions.\nThe fuels most used to power thermal plant generators directly or indirectly are petroleum byproducts (diesel oil,  fuel  oil  and  asphalt  waste),  coal,  natural  gas  and  nuclear  fuels.  In  line  with  the  Company's  strategy  to decarbonize  its  portfolio,  as  from  May  31,  2023,  when  the  sale  of  Pampa  Sul  Thermoelectric  Plant  was completed, coal is no longer used as a fuel source, and the Company currently has three biomass thermoelectric plants that do not require the use of fossil fuels, being fueled with wood waste (Lages Cogeneration Unit) and sugarcane bagasse (TPP Ibitiúva Bioenergética and TPP Ferrari). Cogeneration technology has been developed to heighten energy efficiency for production from thermoelectric plants. This pursuit of efficiency is due to the fact that most of the energy contained in fuel used by generators is  transformed into heat and lost to the environment, while part of the energy from fuel is transformed into electricity.\nUsing cogeneration, heat produced to generate electricity is also partly used in industrial facilities or buildings (commercial, residential etc.) that require heat (steam or hot water) for their production processes. This means that consumers save the fuel they would need to produce heat for the process. Cogeneration energy efficiency levels are much higher than those of other generating sources.\nFurthermore,  cogeneration  processes  often  use  environmentally  friendly  fuels  called  'biomass',  such  as sugarcane bagasse, rice husks, wood waste etc. The biomass energy generation unit is similar to a cogeneration unit, the only difference being the generation of energy solely for the National Interconnected System - SIN. Due to the fuel used, this generation unit must be located close to a sugar and ethanol plant to use waste from its production. Wind energy generation is considered a renewable and clean energy source. Energy is generated through wind turbines using wind power to generate energy. Energy derived from a system of photovoltaic panels capturing sunlight to begin the process of transforming it into electricity. When particles of sunlight (photons) collide with the semiconductor material on a photovoltaic panel, the latter's electrons begin to move and generate electricity.",
  "Energy production is directly related to the plant's equipment performance. There may be interruptions due to failure or lack of availability for maintenance purposes.\nRisks inherent to the Company's production process may be expressed by the following performance indicators: generating units' failure rates and unavailability. Interruptions are classified in two main groups: scheduled and forced.\nScheduled  interruptions  are  due  to  shutdowns  for  generating  unit  maintenance  following  strict  schedules negotiated in advance with the ONS in order to minimize or avoid impacts on the electricity system. Therefore, their impact on the Company's business can be considered as causing very low risk or even no risk.\nForced  interruptions  are  those  arising  from  untimely  disruptions  that  cause  or  require  stoppages  at  the generating units, or partial reduction in energy production capacity.\nFailure rates express the incidence of forced shutdowns. The analysis of this index takes into account the origin of failures and their impact on the electricity system, which can be external to or inside the facilities.\nIn accordance with its insurance contracting strategy, the Company has coverage against losses due to loss of profits caused by accidents that disrupt energy production.\na.4.5.1) Risks of production interruption - CCEAR and CER Reimbursements - Trairi, Campo Largo and Umburanas Wind Complexes, and Assu, Floresta and Paracatu Photovoltaic Complexes\nThese plants have signed availability contracts that stipulate that distributors must pay fixed revenue regardless of  the  generation  volumes  recorded  each  month.  Reimbursement  calculations  take  the  difference  between generation (energy delivered), which is impacted by wind or solar radiation, and the contractual amount sold.\na.4.6) Information on gas transportation activities carried out by the jointly controlled subsidiary 'TAG'\nAdditionally, the Company operates in the natural gas transportation and storage segment in general through its jointly controlled Transportadora Associada de Gás S.A. (TAG). As of December 31, 2023, TAG's high pressure gas pipeline infrastructure was approximately 4,500 km in length, with 11 gas compression facilities (six of which are owned) and 90 points of delivery.\na.5) Characteristics of transmission process",
  "On  December  15,  2017,  through  Aneel's  Transmission  Auction  No.  002/2017,  The  Company  entered  the transmission  segment  by  purchasing  approximately  1,000  kilometers  of  lines  connecting  to  five  substations located  in  the  State  of  Paraná.  The  service  concession  term,  including  construction  and  maintenance  of transmission facilities, is 30 years as of the date of signing the contract. The project reached full commercial operation on February 19, 2023. On March 3, 2020, having fulfilled the conditions precedent set forth in the purchase and sale contract, the company completed its acquisition of 100% of shares in Novo Estado, which holds the concession for Lot 3 of Aneel's Transmission Auction No. 002/2017, held in December 2017. The purpose of said concession is the construction,  operation  and  maintenance  of  approximately  1,800  kilometers  of  transmission  lines,  one  new substation and expansion of three other existing substations in the states of Pará and Tocantins for a period of 30 years. On February 27, 2023, the Company completed the implementation of the Novo Estado Project. On June 30, 2022, the Company successfully bid for Lot 7 of Aneel Transmission Auction No. 001/2022. The scope of this project involves expanding the Itacaiúnas substation in the State of Pará, which has a strong synergy with Transmissora Novo Estado since it is connected to the same substation. Likewise, on June 30, 2023, ENGIE made another successful bid for a lot at Aneel's Transmission Auction No. 001/2023, for the project named 'Asa Branca', its scope being the construction, operation and maintenance of four electricity transmission lines totaling approximately 1,000 kilometers in length, passing through the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo. Its 30-year concession contract was signed on September 29, 2023.\nThe main service,  equipment  and  materials  contracts  were  signed  at  the  end  of  2023  in  order  to  fulfill  the Company's business plan. Construction is to be completed within 66 months at most, stipulating at least 24 months in advance. The Company is not responsible for distributing  the  energy  it  generates  and  supplies  to  its  customers.  The distribution of electricity produced by its plants to serve its customers is the responsibility of SIN's transmission and distribution companies directly connected to the Company's plants according to the sector's operating rules, as mentioned below in item 1.6 of this Reference Form.",

The Company's main suppliers provide fuel that is used for generating electricity, mainly biomass suppliers, as shown above in item 1.4.e.i of this Reference Form.\nThe Company also has several suppliers of fixed assets arising from the construction of its plants; there are no long-term partnerships with these suppliers.\nSupplier selection criteria reflect the Company's commitments against corruption, respect for human rights and preservation of the environment. The Company does not accept child, forced or compulsory labor, and it reserves the right to avoid commercial relations with entities that adopt any of these practices, while also committing to report to the relevant authorities any cases it might become aware of in the conduction of its operations.",
  "The Company has diversified its customer base as part of its business strategy, focusing on free consumers. This segment's share in the Company's portfolio was 37% and 44% of total physical sales in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively.\nThe Company's strategy is to maintain the free consumer segment's share in its portfolio. For this purpose, it strives to fulfill the energy needs of each customer's production process by customizing sales contracts with different alternatives in terms of flexible consumption, supply periods and other commercial conditions.\nOne of the main customer loyalty instruments used in recent years has been the ongoing 'Customer Relationship Program', which consists of  a  wide  range  of  initiatives  such  as  inviting  them  to  visit  our  plants,  sponsoring electricity  sector  events,  and  holding  'ENGIE  Meetings'  featuring  presentations  on  matters  of  interest  to customers with focus on economy, politics and the energy market. In addition to relationship initiatives directly targeting customers, the Company also focuses on digital customer experiences. ' Energy Place', the first digital platform for trading energy on Brazil's free market, completed three years in November 2023. As a pioneering initiative serving small and medium-sized businesses, Energy Place recorded over 750 transactions by December 31, 2023. Energy Place encompasses an energy e-commerce and a Customer and Manager Portal, developed to provide information, record consumption history, and serve as a 100% digital relationship and service channel.\nResults from the Company's commercial and customer loyalty initiatives, among others, are measured by its annual 'Customer Satisfaction Survey' conducted through a digital platform. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the survey found that 93% of customers were either satisfied or very satisfied.\nThe Company's objectives in the commercial area are: (i) promoting the optimization and efficiency of customers' portfolio through flexible prices, terms and conditions; (ii) maintaining solid relationships with customers and cultivating  closer  contacts  with  them;  (iii)  having  more  predictable  long-term  cash  flows  to  obtain  higher percentage shares of the consumer market, entering into contracts in both regulated and free markets; and (iv) leveraging any short-term business opportunities as a means to maximizing the Company's earnings.",

Pursuant to Law No. 10,848, of March 15, 2004, all new sales to distributors are made through auctions regulated by the Federal Government in order to find the lowest purchase price.\nMost bilateral contracts have mechanisms designed to protect the Company from defaulting on payments for supply, such as Bank Letters of Guarantee and Surety Bond, leading to almost zero default level in the customer portfolio.  Furthermore,  as  a  mechanism  to  inhibit  termination  by  the  respective  buyers,  bilateral  contracts establish termination fines that reflect the remainder of the contractual term.\nLong-term  energy  sales  contracts  have  their  prices  adjusted  annually  according  to  IGP-M  or  IPCA  inflation indices, or a combination of both.",
  "As of December 31, 2023, the total installed capacity operated by the Company was 10,034.0 MW, operating its own generating complex producing 8,324.1 MW. The Company's main government-controlled competitors were: Cemig, Copel, Itaipu and Petrobras, in addition to the following privately controlled companies: AES, CPFL, CTG, Eletrobras, ENEL, Eneva, Neoenergia, and others.\nThe Company's main customers are distributors, free consumers and electricity traders, located in the South, Southeast, Northeast and Midwest regions of Brazil.\nc.4) Positioning in the competitive market\nThe Company's controlling interest is held by ENGIE Brasil Participações Ltda., which is incorporated in Brazil and controlled by the ENGIE Economic Group, based in France. In Brazil, the ENGIE Group is among the country's largest private electricity generators and it accounts for approximately 4.9% of Brazil's installed capacity (based on data from December 31, 2023).\nThe  Company's  generation  portfolio  matches  the  desired  level  of  risk  and  enables  competitive  prices.  The locations of plants (South, Southeast/Midwest, North and Northeast) tend to reduce sub-market risks.\nThe  Company  maintains  close  relationships  with  its  customers  in  order  to  detect  their  needs  and  develop individualized products and services that build loyalty.\nThe  Company's  competitive  positioning  is  also  expressed  by  its  presence  in  new  business  areas  such  as cogeneration and generation from alternative sources (complementary energies such as wind, biomass, small hydroelectric power plants and solar energy), thus leveraging its advantages from operating plants with different sizes, characteristics and energy sources.\nThe Company's commercial philosophy is consolidated around meeting customer needs, while constantly striving to build long-lasting and constructive commercial relationships.\nThe Company also benefits from synergies generated across other ENGIE Group companies. Both the expansion process and the entry in new strategic markets are supported by the Group's solid organizational and financial structure, and management's extensive international experience.",
  "There  is  no  relevant  impact  on  consolidated  electricity  sales  due  to  seasonality.  The  Company's  physical guarantee  is  largely  contracted  for  the  coming  years.  Cancellation  of  contracted  energy  must  be  gradually negotiated in subsequent years and, in the case of non-contracting, it may be negotiated through short-term bilateral transactions or settled in the Short-Term Market (CCEE).\nAdditionally, the Company has other risk management tools, such as the seasonality of it's the physical guarantee of its hydroelectric generating park, in addition to generating complementarity among its various plants.\nAdditionally, the Company's hydroelectric power plants are part of the Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE), which  plays  a  crucial  role  in  ensuring  the  Brazilian  electrical  system's  security  and  stability.  The  MRE  was designed for its members to share financial risks when selling energy from hydroelectric power plants dispatched by the ONS on a centralized and optimized basis.\nIt minimizes long-term risk from selling energy and shares the risk among its member agents. The Company's main raw material for its energy matrix includes water resources used in hydroelectric projects for which it holds concessions from regulatory agencies. Its energy matrix includes other energy sources, among which we would highlight the use of inputs and raw materials such as biomass.\ne.1) Description of relationships with suppliers, including whether they are subject to government control or regulations, indicating the agencies and the respective legislation",
  "Lages Cogeneration Unit (UCLA) consumes biomass originated from the logging industry in the State of Santa Catarina's mountainous regions, having been conceived as a sustainable and ecologically correct alternative for disposal of waste from the logging process, allowing for the trading of carbon credits. The plant's basic supply is ensured by around 20 (twenty) mid-term contracts, with five (5) year terms, where the prices of purchased inputs (sawdust, chips, slabs, barks etc.) are priced according to their energy content and subject to annual revision, negotiated in light of the market reality.\nAlong with these regular biomass purchases, UCLA also makes complementary purchases in the region's spot market, thus contributing to the management of inventories kept there. Complementary acquisitions minimize the impacts of supply seasonality that characterize the extraction, processing and manufacturing of forestry inputs.\nIn other units that use this fuel, that is, TPP Ibitiúva and TPP Ferrari, biomass is supplied by consortium companies Consórcio Andrade and Ferrari Agro respectively, while the volumes supplied depend on these plants' generating capacity levels.\ne.2) Possible dependence on a few suppliers\nAs mentioned in item c.1.2. above, there may be dependence on certain suppliers of inputs and raw materials due to supply limitations, mainly as a result of the Brazilian electricity sector's operating characteristics, as well as the technical specifications of equipment used in the facilities. So, the Company has few suppliers available and, for certain equipment items, it has only one supplier. Input and raw material price volatility is related to varying inflation and exchange rates, as well as the prices used for adjusting contracts, as mentioned in item c.1.2. above. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total net revenue in the last fiscal year. Not applicable, since no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total net revenue in the last fiscal year.",
  "Companies or consortiums planning to build and/or operate hydroelectric facilities with power above 50 MW, or operate in energy transmission or distribution in Brazil must take part in bidding processes. Companies or consortia that wish to operate in commercialization, hydroelectric generation with power above 5 MW but not more than 50 MW, or in thermal generation above 5 MW must apply for authorization or permission from the Ministry  of  Mines  and  Energy  (MME)  or  the  electric  regulatory  agency  (Aneel),  whichever  is  appropriate. Concessions, authorizations and permits entail rights to generate, transmit or distribute electricity in a certain concession area for a defined period of up to 35 years for new generation concessions or 30 years for new transmission or distribution concessions. Under this rule, generating concessions prior to December 11, 2003 may  be  renewed  or  extended  for  another  20  (twenty)  years  at  the  Granting  Authority's  discretion  as  per legislation.\nThe publication of Provisional Measure No. 579, on September 11, 2012 (converted into Law No. 12,783 on January 11, 2013) introduced changes and new disciplines in relation to the extension of electricity concessions regulated by Law No. 9,074/ 1995. Under this rule, generating concessions granted before the publication of Law No. 8,987/1995 that have not been subject to bidding processes, may be extended once for a period of up to 30 years at the Granting Authority's discretion. Extension will depend on concessionaires stating their express acceptance of: (i) tariffs calculated by Aneel; (ii) allocation of quotas of physical guarantee of energy and power to distributors of the National Interconnected System (SIN); and (iii) compliance with the service quality standards set by Aneel.\nDue to uncertainty concerning the renewal of concessions held by the Company and the conditions for renewals, prudence  is  required  when  defining  accounting  procedures,  considering,  for  these  purposes,  limiting  the depreciation period of assets included in the original project to the first concession period of these assets, since the interpretation of the specific legislation is that there is no certainty as to the granting authority paying out compensation for investments that have not yet been amortized by the end of the concession period.\nFurthermore, considering that a significant number of electricity transmission concessions will be expiring as from 2025 (especially from 2030 onwards), Brazil's Federal Government has enacted Decree No. 11,314/2022 to regulate bidding processes and the renewal or extension of electricity transmission concessions under Law No. 9,074/1995. Decree No. 11,314/2022 stipulates the following:\n· As a rule, once transmission concessions have ended, the Granting Authority will open public tenders for these concessions, rather than postponing their expiration. Current transmission concessionaires will be eligible to take part in these bidding processes.\n· After a public consultation held by Aneel, concession periods may be extended if the public bidding is seen as unfeasible or harmful to the public interest. The public consultation's result and Aneel's decision must be submitted to the MME for its final decision on the renewal not later than 21 (twenty-one) months before the concession contract expiry date;\n· New concessionaires, if applicable, will be responsible for compensation payments related to investments made by the previous holder if these investments have not yet been amortized or depreciated. This payment will be a condition precedent for executing a new concession contract; and\n· In the event of renewal, any delay in signing the addendum will rule out the extension of the concession. The extension of concession terms will (i) occur without prior payment of compensation related to unamortized or non-depreciated investments; and (ii) depend on a concessionaire's acceptance of revenues and other conditions stipulated in the addendum .",
  "Regarding the renewal process stipulated in Law No. 9,074/1995 and Law No. 12,783/2013, the application for renewal must be submitted at least 36 months before a concession agreement expires, together with evidence of good standing and compliance with tax and social security obligations, as well as commitments and charges involving  public  administration  entities  related  to  the  operation  of  electricity  transmission  facilities.  After submission of the renewal request, Aneel may make a recommendation as to whether a concession should be extended or renewed. After Aneel's recommendation on the matter, the process must be submitted to the MME, which will issue a final administrative decision as to whether the renewal should be granted to the concessionaire.\nAmong other provisions, Law No. 8,987/1995 states the conditions that concessionaires must fulfill to provide energy  services,  consumer  rights,  and  concessionaire  and  Granting  Authority  obligations.  Furthermore,  the concessionaire must comply with current electricity sector regulations. The Concessions Law's main provisions are summarized as follows:\n· adequate services: the concessionaire must provide adequate services in order to satisfy the parameters of regularity, continuity, efficiency, safety, timeliness, generality, courtesy the provision of services, reasonable tariffs and access to services.\n· strict liability: the concessionaires are liable for all direct or indirect damages that arise from providing their services, or through outsourced contractors, regardless of their fault.\n· changes in controlling interest: the Granting Authority must approve any direct or indirect change in the concessionaire's controlling interest.\n· intervention by the Granting Authority: the Granting Authority may intervene in a concession in order to ensure adequate performance of services and full compliance with relevant contractual, regulatory and legal provisions if the concessionaire fails to fulfill its obligations.\n· reversion upon contractual term: reversion upon the contractual term will apply with compensation of the portions of the investment linked to reversible assets that have not yet been amortized or depreciated, and that have been made to ensure continuity and timeliness of services.\n· production of electricity by Independent Producers and Self-Producers: at the end of the concession or authorization period, the assets and facilities created for independent generation and self-production of electricity  from  hydraulic  means  will  become  part  of  the  Federal  Government's  assets,  subject  to compensation for investments not yet amortized. To determine the amount of compensation to be paid, the amounts of subsequent investments, approved and made but not stipulated in the original  project,  and depreciation  determined  by  the  Granting  Authority  audit,  will  be  considered.  In  the  case  of  a  TPP  no compensation will be due for investments made, but the Independent Producer or Self-Producer is ensured the right to remove them.\n· early  termination  of  concession: the  early  termination  of  a  concession  contract  may  occur  through expropriation, forfeiture, termination, annulment and/or bankruptcy or extinction of the concessionaire, and death  or  incapacity  of  holder  in  the  case  of  an  individual  company.  Expropriation  consists  of  the  early termination of a concession for reasons related to the public interest, through compensation; forfeiture consists  of  resumption  of  activity  and  assets  granted  by  the  Granting  Authority  after  an  administrative proceeding that ensures all rights and guarantees relating to a 'due legal process', in which it is evidenced that the concessionaire, without justification: (i) failed to provide adequate or full services, based on the",
  "rules, criteria, indicators and standards that define the quality of services; (ii) failed to adequately comply with its obligations stipulated in the concession contract or legal or regulatory provisions relating to the concession;  (iii)  suspended  the  service  or  contributed  to  its  suspension,  except  in  cases  arising  from unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure; (iv) no longer has the technical, financial or economic capacity needed to provide adequate services; (v)  has  not complied  with any penalties  imposed by the  Granting Authority; (vi) has not responded to a Granting Authority summons to regularize the provision of services; and (vii) was found guilty in a final and unappealable decision for evading taxes, including contributions. The concessionaire is entitled to compensation a posteriori for its investments in reversible assets that have not been fully amortized or depreciated, after deducting any fines and damages owed by the concessionaire. Finally, contractual termination may be decided by mutual agreement between the parties or as a result of a non-appealable court decision rendered in a legal action brought by the concessionaire.\nConsidering exclusively the interpretation of the abovementioned legislation, according to which there is no guarantee of compensation from the Granting Authority for the residual value of assets comprising the original project  at  the  end  of  the  concession  and  authorization  period  for  hydroelectric  projects  and,  given  the abovementioned need for prudence, the Company started depreciating these assets as from January 1, 2007 at the rates determined by Aneel, limiting them to the concession period, considering the Company's understanding that these rates represent the assets' useful lives, although legislation and contracts stipulate the possibility of renewing the concession. It should be mentioned that fixed assets acquired until January 1, 2007 were subject to the adoption of deemed cost based on the assessment of their fair values on January 1, 2009, the date of transition  to  the  international  accounting  standards  (IFRS)  and  new  accounting  pronouncements  issued  by Brazil's Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC).",
  "Aneel's regulations stipulate sanctions and penalties against electricity sector agents and classify penalties based on  the  nature  and  materiality  of  violations  (including  warnings,  fines,  construction  embargoes,  interdicted facilities, temporary suspension of the right to bid for new concessions, permits or authorizations, prohibition to contract with Aneel or to receive authorization for electricity services and facilities, withdrawal or suspension of authorization for commercial operation, administrative intervention or forfeiture).\nFor each violation, fines may reach 2% of revenue arising from electricity sales and provision of services - after deduction of ICMS and ISSQN taxes - by the concessionaires in the 12-month period immediately prior to issuing a violation notice, as per Aneel's Regulatory Resolution No. 846/2019. Some violations that may lead to fines refer to the agent's failure to apply for Aneel's approval relating to:\n· signing contracts between related parties in cases stipulated in the regulations;\n· sale or assignment of assets related to services provided, as well as any encumbrances or liens (including any type of guarantee, deposit, surety, pledge or mortgage) on revenue from energy services; and\n· amendment  to  the  bylaws,  share  transfers  that entail a change  in shareholding control, or the concessionaire's corporate restructuring.\nIn the case of contracts signed between related parties, Aneel may at any time apply restrictions to their terms and conditions and, in extreme circumstances, order their termination.\nFurthermore, in relation to delayed implementation of transmission projects under concession, the penalties to be  applied  will  consist  of  contractual  and  public  notice  fines,  rather  than  the  fine  based  on  Aneel's abovementioned Regulatory Resolution No. 846/2019, which will be used as from the beginning of commercial operations  or  merely  on  a  subsidiary  basis  during  the  deployment  period.  This  was  Aneel's  understanding expressed in Technical Note No. 53/2022-SFE/Aneel, which addressed the amount of the fine to be applied in cases of unjustified delays at the beginning of commercial operations of transmission concessions.\nOn this occasion, Aneel's understanding was that the penalty could be a fine of up to 10% of the amount invested in  the  project  (corresponding  to  the  budget  of  the  concession's  contract  updated  using  the  contractually stipulated annual adjustment index), to be calculated based on the phase of the project and length of delay, in addition to discounting, in the monthly installment, the permitted annual revenue ('RAP') of the transmission concessionaire through application of the Variable Portion Due to Delay ('PVA').\na.1.2) Concessions and Authorizations\nThe Company and its subsidiaries hold the following electricity concessions and authorizations:",

  "The conditions for compensation through grant extension for MRE participants were established by Law No. 14,052, published on September 9, 2020, and regulated by Aneel Regulatory Resolution No. 1,035/2022. The legislation stipulates compensation for concessionaires of hydroelectric power plants participating in the MRE for  effects  caused  by  the  so-called  'structuring'  generation  projects,  related  to  the  provision  of  physical guarantees in advance, as well as to restrictions and delays in the start of operations of transmission facilities required  to  distribute  the  energy  from  these  plants,  thermal  generation  beyond  the  order  of  merit  and importation, retroactively. As compensation, generators are assured the right to renew or extend their generating concession period for up to seven years.\nOn December 15, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the adhesion of the Company and its subsidiaries holding electricity generation concessions to this compensation through grant extension, as stipulated by Law No. 14,052/2020.\nOn March 2, 2021, the Electricity Trading Chamber ('CCEE') published the review of compensation calculations, which included: (i) application of the discount rate to calculate grant extensions; (ii) considering the impacts resulting from expiration of the Abengoa and Isolux concessions on the output from HPP Belo Monte; and (iii) recognition of the right of quota-based plants, under Law No. 12,783/2013, to compensation calculated per Law No. 14,052/2020.\nAdditionally, Law No. 14,182 enacted July 12, 2021 addressed, among other matters, the retroactive effects of the Generation Scaling Factor (GSF), and from then on included, for the purposes of renegotiating hydrologic risk addressed by Law No. 14,052/2020. losses caused between 2012 and 2014 to hydroelectric power plants contracted in the regulated market, which had already renegotiated hydrological risk in 2015. Therefore, it was explicitly  stipulated  that,  for  the  period  prior  to  initial  validity  of  hydrological  risk  renegotiation,  the  entire physical guarantee of the plants would be considered as a portion of energy not renegotiated for reimbursement purposes.  On  September  9,  2021,  the  Electricity  Trading  Chamber  ('CCEE')  published  the  final  revision  of compensation calculations.\nAneel  approved  extended  concession  periods  for  plants  belonging  to  the  MRE  that  had  not  renegotiated hydrological risk in 2015 as from the publication of Ratifying Resolution No. 2,919, published on August 12, 2021. This approval covered the following Company plants: Salto Osório, Passo Fundo, Jaguara and Miranda. Additionally, on September 17, 2021, Ratifying Resolution No. 2,932 was published to approve the extension period  for  the  concession  of  hydroelectric  power  plants  participating  in  the  MRE  and  affected  by  the  new treatment of the period prior to the beginning of validity of the renegotiation of hydrological risk. This approval covered the following Company plants: Salto Santiago, Cana Brava, São Salvador and Ponte de Pedra.

Subsequent to the approval of Law No. 10,848, on March 15, 2004 ('New Electricity Sector Model Law' 2 ), the Federal Government, acting mainly through the MME, assumed certain responsibilities previously covered by Aneel. The duties assumed include drafting guidelines to govern the granting of concessions and issuing rules governing bidding processes for concessions of public services and electricity facilities.",
  "The Brazilian electricity sector is regulated by Aneel, an autonomous government agency. After the enactment of the New Electricity Sector Model Law, Aneel's main responsibilities now include: (i) regulating and supervising the electricity sector according to the policy determined by the MME; and (ii) responding to questions delegated to  it  by  the  Federal  Government  and  the  MME.  Aneel's  current  responsibilities  include  the  following:  (i) supervising concessions for electricity generation, transmission and distribution activities, including approval of electricity tariffs; (ii) enacting electricity sector regulations; (iii) implementing and regulating exploration of energy sources, including hydroelectric energy; (iv) holding bidding processes for new concessions through delegation from  the  MME;  (v)  resolving  administrative  disputes  between  electricity  sector  agents;  and  (vi)  determining criteria and methodology for setting transmission tariffs.\na.1.3.3) National Energy Policy Council ('CNPE')\nIn August 1997, the National Energy Policy Council ('CNPE') was created to develop and create the National Energy Policy.

Its purpose is to optimize the use of Brazil's energy resources in order to ensure that demand is met.\na.1.3.4) National Electric System Operator ('ONS')\nThe  ONS  was  created  in  1998  as  a  private,  non-profit  entity  consisting  of  generators,  transmission  and distribution companies, free consumers, and other agents such as electricity importers and exporters.\nThe 'New Electricity Sector Model Law' granted Federal Government powers to appoint three members of the ONS Executive Board. The main role of the ONS is to coordinate and control the Interconnected System's generation and transmission operations, subject to Aneel's regulation and supervision.\n2 Law No. 10,848/2004, at the time of its discussion and publication, was known as the 'New Electricity Sector Model Law'. Bill 1917/2015 is currently being discussed by the Legislative Branch. It proposes a new Electricity Sector reform known as the 'Modernization and Opening of the Free Energy Market Law'.\nThe ONS' objectives and main responsibilities include: (i) planning electrical energy generation and transmission operations; (ii) organizing and controlling the use of the National Interconnected System ('SIN') and international interconnections;  (iii)  ensuring  non-discriminatory  access  to  the  transmission  network  for  all  of  the  sector's agents; (iv) providing support to plan the electrical system's expansion; (v) submitting proposals to the MME for the Basic Network's expansion - said proposals will be taken into consideration when planning the transmission system's  expansion;  (vi)  proposing  transmission  system  operating  standards  for  Aneel's  approval;  and  (vii) developing an optimized dispatch program based on availability declared by generation agents.",
  "As of 2004, the CCEE succeeded the Wholesale Energy Market ('MAE') and has absorbed all its activities and assets.\nCCEE's main role is to make electricity trading possible in the National Interconnected System ('SIN'), being responsible for: (i) registering all energy trading contracts on the Regulated Contracting Environment ('ACR'), contracts  resulting  from  contractual  adjustments  and  contracts  signed  in  the  Free  Contracting  Environment ('ACL'); and (ii) accounting for short-term transactions and their settlement.\nThe  CCEE  consists  of  holders  of  electricity  sector  concessions,  permits  and  authorizations,  as  well  as  Free Consumers and Special Consumers. Its Board of Directors consists of four members appointed by the agents, and one member appointed by the MME, who holds the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors.\nPer Decree No. 5,163, of July 30, 2004, the calculation of the price of electricity purchased or sold in the shortterm market - or 'PLD' - is the responsibility of CCEE and takes into account, among other factors: (i) optimized use of electricity resources to cover system loads; (ii) agents' electricity needs; and (iii) the cost of the electricity deficit.\nAneel's Regulatory Resolution No. 957/2021 introduced the Electricity Trading Convention, which determines CCEE's structure and operating rules. Among other matters, it stipulates obligations and rights of CCEE agents, means of settling conflicts, conditions for trading electricity in the regulated and free markets, and the accounting recognition and financial settlement process for short-term market transactions.\nAs  from  January  1,  2017,  CCEE  became  responsible  for  managing  and  operating  the  Energy  Development Account ('CDE'), the Fuel Consumption Account ('CCC') and the Global Reversal Reserve ('RGR'), which used to be under the responsibility of Eletrobras, per Law No. 13,360 of November 17, 2016, which determined CCEE's role as manager of the aforementioned sectoral accounts. The creation of the EPE was authorized by Law No. 10,847, of March 15, 2004. As a federal public company, it undertakes analyses to support planning for the energy sector, including electricity, oil, gas, coal and renewable energy sources, as well as energy efficiency. Analyses and research developed by EPE support the formulation, planning and execution of MME's initiatives within the scope of National Energy Policy.",
  "On August 9, 2004, Brazil's Federal Government enacted the decree that created the CMSE as an entity chaired and coordinated by the MME, and consisting of representatives from Aneel, the National Petroleum Agency ('ANP'),  CCEE,  EPE  and  ONS.  CMSE's  main  responsibilities  are:  (i)  monitoring  energy  sector  activities;  (ii) assessing the electricity market supply and fulfillment conditions; and (iii) drafting proposals for preventive or remedial measures in order to maintain or restore secure electricity supply and services, and forwarding them to the CNPE.\na.1.3.8) New Electricity Sector Model Law (Law No. 10,848/2004)\nThe New Electricity Sector Model Law introduced significant changes in the electricity sector regulations in order to:  (i)  provide  incentives for  private  and  public  companies to build and maintain generating capacity; and (ii) ensure electricity supply in Brazil through bidding processes. The main changes introduced by the New Electricity Sector Model Law include:\n· creation of two markets for energy trading: (i) a market for the sale of electricity to concessionaires and energy distribution licensees, in order to guarantee the supply of electricity to captive consumers, by means of bidding procedures or auctions governed by strict public rules, said market to be named 'ACR'; and (ii) an ACL, in which negotiations between energy generators, traders and end consumers are conducted bilaterally, thus enabling more dynamic competition between agents;\n· obligation of the distribution companies to acquire enough energy to meet 100% of their demand;\n· restrictions for certain activities of distributors, in order to ensure that these companies focus exclusively on providing public distribution services, ensuring more efficient and reliable services for captive consumers, avoiding any impacts on tariffs of costs arising from activities not related to the concession;\n· assurance (own physical guarantee or third-party purchase contracts) for all contractually sold energy;\n· mandatory purchase of electricity by distributors exclusively through auctions held by Aneel, eliminating the possibility of self-dealing in order to ensure that electricity is purchased at the lowest prices available on the market; and\n· fulfillment of contracts signed before the effectiveness of the 'New Electricity Sector Model Law', in order to ensure legal security to operations carried out before the law's enactment.\na.1.4) Energy Trading\nThe commercialization of energy as an autonomous activity is stipulated in the Electricity Sector Law and Decree No. 2,655 of July 2, 1998, and it is subject to a competitive regime in which several agents may participate, including generation companies, operating under a public service or independent production system, energy traders and importers.",
  "The 'New Electricity Sector Model Law' states that negotiations involving the purchase and sale of electricity must be conducted in two different market segments that operate within the scope of the CCEE: (i) the ACR, which includes purchases made by distributors in public auctions to serve their captive consumers; and (ii) the ACL, which comprises direct sale of electricity between generation agents, traders and free consumers.\nElectricity from (i) small generation capacity projects directly connected to low- and medium-voltage systems distributed generation; (ii) plants that are eligible under Proinfa rules, as defined below; and (iii) HPP Itaipu, will not be subject to centralized auction processes for supplying energy to the ACR.\nThe electricity generated by HPP Itaipu is traded by Eletrobras and the volumes that must be purchased by each distributor are compulsorily determined by Aneel. The prices at which the energy generated by HPP Itaipu is traded with Eletrobras, are indexed to the US dollar and established in accordance with a treaty signed between Brazil and Paraguay. Provisional Measure No. 579, of September 11, 2012, converted into Law No. 12,783, on January 11, 2013, stated that the Federal Government may assume the effects of exchange rate variations on Itaipu Binacional energy transfer tariff. HPP Itaipu prices for end consumers are no longer subject to exchange fluctuation.\nEnergy distributors' purchases from distributed generation processes, wind power sources and SHPs must follow a competitive publicly announced process to ensure publicity, transparency and equal access.",
  "Under  the  'New  Electricity  Sector  Model  Law',  in  the  scope  of  ACR,  the  Energy  Trading  Contracts  in  the Regulated Market (CCEAR) must be signed between each generator and the SIN distributors, which must offer guarantees to generators. Amendments introduced by Law No. 13,360 of November 17, 2016 require contracts between distributors and generators to stipulate delivery of energy as from the year of the respective bidding process until the following year, and their terms must be from 1 year at least to 15 years at most. Contracts between distributors and new projects of generation companies provide for delivery of energy from the 3 rd  to the 7 th year as from the respective bidding process, and durations of at least 15 years and at most 35 years.\nIn  the  ACR  market,  distribution  companies  purchase  energy  they  expect  to  sell  to  their  captive  consumers through  bidding  processes  regulated  by  Aneel  and  organized  by  CCEE.  The  electricity  is  purchased  from generators, traders and importers, and purchases may be made through two types of bilateral contracts: (i) Energy Quantity Contracts; and (ii) Energy Availability Contracts.\nUnder an Energy Quantity  Contract,  selling  agents  undertake  to  supply  a  certain  amount  of  electricity  and assume the risk that the supply may be affected by hydrological conditions and low reservoir levels, among other factors that may affect the allocated energy. Otherwise, under the terms of the Energy Availability Contracts, the generator undertakes to keep its plant available for generation at any time upon request by the ONS, earning a fixed income regardless of its actual generation. The project's cost of fuel resulting from the ONS dispatch order is borne by the contracting parties.\nDistributors are required to contract 100% of their electricity needs. Insufficient electricity to supply the entire market is checked in CCEE's accounting recognition process and may lead to penalties for distributors.\nEnergy distributors have the right to pass on to their consumers any costs related to the electricity acquired through auctions, as well as any sectoral taxes and charges related to the auctions. Variations between estimated revenues, and the amounts actually required to honor energy purchase contracts are adjusted in the following cycle.",
  "Distributors  may  reduce  the  amount  of  energy  contracted  through  the  CCEAR  in  the  following  cases:  (i) compensation for the exit of potentially free consumers from the regulated market to the ACL; (ii) deviations from demand estimates prepared by distributors, after two years of the initial demand declaration, in which case the reduction could reach up to 4% per year of the initially contracted amount; and (iii) increase in the amounts of energy acquired through contracts signed before March 17, 2004. The 'New Electricity Sector Model Law' establishes that, in a situation in which the Federal Government decrees a compulsory reduction in energy consumption in a given region, all Energy Quantity Contracts on the ACR, registered by the CCEE, must have their respective volumes adjusted in the same proportion as the reduction in consumption.\na.1.4.3) The Free Contracting Environment ('ACL')\nThe sale of energy between generation companies, independent producers, self-producers, electricity traders, energy importers and free consumers is carried out on the ACL.\nFree Consumers - end consumers who can purchase electricity directly from generation agents or traders. The criterion for eligibility to become a free consumer is to have a minimum load equal to or greater than the limit established by law and applicable norms, which has been 500 kW since January 2023. As from January 2024, per Ordinance 50/2022, any consumer using high voltage services will be eligible.\nSpecial Consumers - are those who have a minimum load of 500 kW or more, individually or together, depending on  pre-determined  conditions,  and  they  may  choose  to  contract  electricity  from  generating  projects  using specific  sources,  namely  biomass  plants,  wind,  solar  energy,  SHPs  or  qualified  cogeneration  systems.  Since January 2023, there is no longer an obligation to purchase from specific sources for this category of consumers, so each individual is free to choose the most beneficial energy source.\nGovernment-owned generation companies, as well as private generation companies, may sell electricity to free consumers; however, government-owned companies must do so through public bidding processes that ensure transparency and equal access to all interested parties. On July 30, 2004, Law No. 10,848/2004 was published to regulate the purchase and sale of energy in the ACR and ACL markets, as well as the authorizations and concessions for energy generation projects, including rules related to auction and bidding procedures, the format for energy purchase contracts and the method for transfer to end consumers, among other matters.\nThe regulations state that all agents purchasing electricity must contract their entire demand according to the new model's  guidelines.  On  the  other  hand,  selling  agents  must  demonstrate  that  the  electricity  they  have available for sale is backed by their own existing generation facilities or energy purchase contracts. Selling agents who do not comply with these requirements will be subject to penalties for insufficient guarantees.",
  "Distributors must contract 100% of their expected electricity demand for their respective concession areas. To this end, distributors must purchase energy at auctions regulated by Aneel (as mentioned previously, there are some exceptional situations where the supply of electricity to a distributor does not require holding regulated auctions, either because the purchase of energy is compulsory - as in Itaipu's case - or because contracting is authorized  through  public  notice  -  Distributed  Generation,  wind  power  sources,  SHPs,  biomass),  either  for purchase from previously existing or new generation projects.\nEnergy auctions for new generation projects will be held from 3 to 7 years before initial delivery date (known as 'A-3', 'A-4', 'A-5', 'A-6' and 'A-7' auctions), in accordance with changes in the mechanism for contracting on the regulated market when Law No 13,360, of November 17, 2016, which resulted from Provisional Measure No. 735, of 2016, was converted into law.\nThere will also be auctions of energy from existing generation facilities held five years before the initial delivery date until [sic] months before delivery date (year 'A' and 'A-1').\nEach selling agent contracting sale of energy through the auction will sign a CCEAR with each distributor, in proportion  to  the  demand  declared  in  the  distributor's  intention  to  purchase.  The  CCEARs  for  new  energy auctions are for terms ranging from 15 to 30 years, while CCEARs for existing energy auctions are for terms ranging from a few months to 15 years. Contracts arising from adjustment auctions will be limited to a period of two years.\nAfter each auction is concluded, generators and distributors sign a CCEAR stating the terms, conditions, prices and amounts of contracted energy. Distributors submit guarantees in favor of generators for which purpose they may choose between bank guarantee, receivables in amounts equivalent to 100% of the average value of the three most recent CCEAR-related invoices, or assigning Bank Deposit Certificates (CDBs).",
  "Adjustment auctions are stipulated by Article 26 of Decree No. 5,163/2004 and by Aneel Regulatory Resolution No. 1,009/2022 in order to supplement the energy load needed to serve a distributors' consumer market, up to a limit of 5 % of this load. The purpose of reserve energy auctions is to sell reserve energy as a means of heightening the security of electricity  supplies  in  the  SIN  that  come  from  plants  specially  contracted  for  this  purpose,  whether  new  or existing generation projects. Auctions for alternative sources are regulated by Decree No. 6,048, of February 27, 2007, which partly amends the  wording  of  Decree  No.  5,163,  of  July  30,  2004.  They  were  introduced  as  mechanisms  to  serve  the distributors' consumer market. Brazil's Constitution states that the development, use and sale of electricity may be carried out directly, by the Federal Government, or indirectly by granting concessions, permits and authorizations to other public agents, as well as to private companies. By delegation from the MME (http://www.mme.gov.br/), Aneel is in charge of the bidding processes for granting concessions for transmission lines and substations in Brazil.\nEPE and ONS, together with the MME, are analyzing plans for the transmission system's expansion in order to ensure that the SIN has adequate capacity and flexibility to meet growing demand, the outflow of energy from new generation sources, the connection of new consumers and the expansion of regional interconnections that can  tap  the  climatic  and  market  diversity  found  in  a  country  of  continental  dimensions  such  as  Brazil,  thus enabling more efficient use of energy resources.\nUnlike generation, transmission planning is determinant. As a reference, the grid's sizing with N-1 reliability criteria (output from a transmission element) is assumed, and more severe situations are also tested (double contingencies, N-2), which must be supported without causing systemic collapse. In this respect, the studies that have been developed, which include technical-economic and social-environmental analyses of alternatives for expansion, will point out the facilities of the basic grid (lines and substations with voltages equal to or higher than 230 kV) that will soon be auctioned or authorized by Aneel regulatory agency, after approval from the MME.",
  "In relation to transferring electricity acquisition costs from auctions to end consumer tariffs, the Government has introduced a mechanism known as 'Annual Reference Value' ('VR'), which is a weighted average of electricity acquisition  costs  for  year  'A'  for  all  distributors,  arising  from  the  'A-5'  and  'A-3'  auctions  and  Structuring Projects.\nThe VR is an incentive for distributors to purchase their electricity needs at auctions as far in advance as possible, and it is applied to limit the extent to which costs are passed on to consumer tariffs by following the criteria stipulated in the Decree.\na.1.5.6) Contracts signed before the New Electricity Sector Model Law\nThe New Electricity Sector Model Law stipulates that energy purchase contracts closed by distributors, and signed and approved by Aneel before the enactment of said Law, cannot be changed to extend the terms or raise the prices or volumes of energy that have already been contractually agreed.\na.1.6) Deverticalization within the scope of the New Regulatory Framework\nDeverticalization  in  the  electricity  sector  was  a  process  applicable  to  companies  that  operated  a  vertically integrated model, in order to segregate electricity generation, transmission and distribution activities, and it was implemented in Brazil from 1995 onwards.\nThe deverticalization process had the following objectives: (i) preserve the identity of each concession, avoiding contamination  in  the  formation  of  costs  and  in  the  remuneration  base  of  public  service  activities,  so  that economic-financial balances of each concession could be gauged to boost transparency in management and keep the  market  and  society  fully  informed  of  the  concession's  results;  and  (ii)  stimulate  the  electricity  sector's competitive aspects for segments in which competition is possible (generation and trading), while also improving the regulation system in segments where there is a grid monopoly (transmission and distribution).\nLaw  10,848/2004  determines  that  holders  of  concessions,  permits  and  authorizations  for  public  electricity distribution  services  operating  in  the  SIN  are  not  allowed  to  carry  out  the  following  activities:  (i)  energy generation energy (except distributed generation); (ii) energy transmission; (iii) selling energy to free consumers\nlocated beyond their concession area; or (iv) directly or indirectly hold equity in other companies, except if this is done to fund, invest and manage the resources required to provide services and when so stipulated in the concession contracts, or activities other than their corporate purpose, except in legally stipulated cases and in the respective concession contracts.\nThe above restrictions do not apply:\n· to the supply of energy to isolated electric systems;\n· to serve their own market, as long as it is under 500 GWh/year; and\n· to  funding,  investments  or  loans  for  use  by  the  distributor  itself  or  a  company  belonging  to  the  same economic group, upon previous consent from Aneel.\nLikewise, generation or transmission companies operating in the SIN must not be affiliates or parent companies that are developing electricity distribution activities in the SIN.\nElectricity distribution, transmission and generation companies had to adapt to the deverticalization rules by September 2005. This period could be extended by Aneel only once if they effectively proved that the rules could not be followed due to factors beyond the control of the concession, permission or authorization holder.",
  "Law No. 10,604/2002 stated that public electricity service concession and permit holders may only offer rights arising from their concession, permission or authorization or any other assets related to the provision of public service, in guarantee of loans, financing or any other transaction related to the respective concession's purpose. Exceptionally,  they  may  offer  guarantees  to  fund  electricity  generation  projects  in  which  they  directly  or indirectly participate, and which were granted before the law in question came into force.\nAneel Regulatory Resolution No. 948/2021 stated that public electricity service concessionaires interested in providing  guarantees  for  previously  awarded  electricity  generation  projects,  must  submit  a  request  for authorization to Aneel, stating the amount, terms and other conditions for their operation. Such guarantees may only be created to support funding for goods and services used to implement the generation projects in question, as long as they belong to the same controlling group as the public electricity service concessionaire's guarantor.\nThis type of guarantee will be authorized for the period corresponding to the project's construction, expiring 180 days after starting commercial operations, characterized by the operation of the last Generating Unit, respecting the date set forth in the plant's deployment schedule approved by Aneel. The above Resolution No. 948/2021 also determines the methodology used for calculating limits to be respected by concessionaires: (i) depending on their indebtedness/total liabilities ratio; or (ii) due to the internal generation of funds calculated annually in the period covered by the guarantee in question.\nThe contractual request must include financing agents' express waiver of any action or right against Aneel or the Granting  Authority  resulting  from  concessionaires'  failure  to  meet  their  commitments.  The  contracting instrument must also state that the use of the proceeds from any compensation for reversible assets for payment to creditors will be limited to the amount of unpaid debts.",
  "On a monthly basis, CCEE calculates and requires all agents to provide financial guarantees based on its analysis of their Short-Term Market ('MCP') exposure for the month to be recognized and settled. If an agent does not provide the full amount of required guarantee, their contracts will not be fully recognized in the month. Any agent that does not fully provide the required guarantee will have started the process of leaving CCEE. Generators generally do not have tariffs set for provision of their services nor a guarantee of economic-financial balance set forth in their grants or concession contracts. Quota-holding plants are exceptions to this rule.\nGenerators may sell their energy: (i) to distributors, through public auctions regulated by Aneel, the so-called 'regulated auctions'; (ii) to distributors, through the distributor's own auctions, for distributed generation; or (iii) to their end consumers in the ACL, through trading agents, for freely negotiated prices and supply conditions.\nThe energy trading capacity of a generation agent is not generally associated with its effective generation, but rather with its physical guarantee defined by the MME. For each type of project (hydroelectric, thermoelectric, wind etc.) specific criteria are defined for calculating and reviewing physical guarantees.\nFor  example,  the  MME  determines  physical  guarantee  for  hydroelectric  generation  projects  based  on computational models for statistical treatment of the history of uptakes in the region in question, its river water flows, and water levels in each of the plants over multi-year periods.\nPhysical guarantee amounts for hydroelectric projects may be reviewed every five years by the MME, or upon occurrence of material facts, up to a limit of 5% of the amount determined by the most recent review, limited to 10% of the amount stated in the respective contracts signed with the Granting Authority.",
  "This mechanism enables surpluses and deficits of energy amounts contracted in the ACR to be reallocated across distribution agents and generators. The mechanism has several modalities, some open to the participation only of generation companies, others only of distribution companies and still others where the participation of both is allowed. Mechanism  that  allows  distributors  to  sell  surplus  energy.  In  cases  of  sales  related  to  amounts  within  the regulatory limit or involuntary over contracting, part of the benefit received is reversed in favor of the consumer during the tariff adjustment process. Distribution agents that have contractual surpluses of electricity may act as sellers in the MVE, while free contracting consumers, special consumers, concessionaires, permission holders and authorized generation agents, traders and self-producer agents that are in compliance with the CCEE may act as buyers at the time of declaring intention to purchase. The MRE mechanism was created to distribute hydrological risk across hydroelectric generation projects. All hydroelectric generation companies with centralized dispatch are compulsory MRE members; in addition, SHPs may join the mechanism on certain conditions. The MRE transfers surplus production from those plants that produced more than their physical guarantee to other members whose logged generation was less than their respective  physical  guarantees.  Energy  transfers  under  the  MRE  are  remunerated  by  a  tariff  known  as  the Optimization  Energy  Tariff  ('TEO)',  which  covers  the  average  operating  and  maintenance  costs  incurred  by hydroelectric power plants. The Itaipu power plant has its own TEO.",
  "The MRE is allocated through a four-step process, as detailed below:\n1. gauge whether total net production within the MRE reaches total physical guarantee levels of the MRE members as a whole;\n2. check whether any generator's generated volumes were above or below their physical guaranteed volumes;\n3. generators  that  have  produced  more  than  their  respective  physical  guarantee  must  transfer  the  excess energy to generators that have generated less than their physical guarantee. Any excess energy generated, known as 'optimized energy', is reallocated firstly among generators within the same submarket, and, then among  different  submarkets,  in  order  to  ensure  that  all  MRE  members  reach  their  respective  physical guarantee levels; and\n4. (i) after step (3) above, if all MRE members have reached their physical guarantee levels and there is a balance of energy produced, additional net generation, designated 'Secondary Energy', must be allocated across generators in the different submarkets; (ii) after step (2) or (3) above, if all MRE members have failed to reach their physical guarantee levels, then MRE members will purchase their shortfall of missing energy from the PLD.\nMRE generator members that produce energy exceeding their physical guarantee levels get compensated for their variable operating and maintenance (O&M) costs plus expenses for royalties charged on water use. If the agreed physical guarantee levels cannot be reached, the generators must pay O&M and royalty costs for the use of water to the generators that produced more than their respective physical guarantee levels during the same period.\nIn situations in which MRE generators as a whole lack sufficient net energy produced to reach the MRE's physical guarantee levels, the allocated physical guarantee is lowered in order to reflect actual MRE generation numbers. In other words, generators receive an allocated energy level that is based on the ratio of their physical guarantee level in relation to that of the MRE as a whole, multiplied by the amount actually generated. Even if some MRE generators generate more than their physical guaranteed levels, if the MRE as a whole is unable to reach the full physical guarantee levels, those generators will nevertheless get allocated physical guarantee levels that will be below their physical guarantee levels.\nIf the MRE generators as a whole lack sufficient net energy produced to reach physical guarantee levels, the MRE generators  must  purchase  energy  from  PLD  in  sufficient  quantities  to  reach  their  respective  physical guarantee levels in the local market. The MRE's mechanism attempts to ensure that all members reach their respective physical guaranteed levels, regardless of amount contracted.",
  "Law No.   13,203 of December 8, 2015, addresses the renegotiation of hydrological risk for electricity generation relative to the energy contracted in the ACR and ACL markets by payment of a risk premium by generators in favor of consumers. The renegotiating rules state options for choosing the hydrological risk level to be assumed by generators, who, in turn, promise to pay a risk premium set by Aneel over the term of the energy sales contract. This contracting mechanism enables a limit to be set to financial exposure of hydroelectric generators in the CCEE. More details of the functioning of the ACR and ACL markets may be found in the item 'Electric Energy Trading Environment'. The total surplus energy after applying the MRE's previous stages is distributed proportionally to the physical guarantees  of  its  participants,  and  is  known  as  'Secondary  Energy'.  This  energy  must  not  be  used  as  sales guarantee in bilateral or regulated contracts, and must be paid at the PLD in the scope of the CCEE. The GSF is derived  from  the  ratio  between  the  total  amount  of  hydroelectric  energy  produced  by  all  MRE members and the respective amounts of assured energy. A GSF below '1' means that hydroelectric energy generated will be less than the allocated physical guarantee and, as such, hydroelectric companies would be exposed to the MCP. By renegotiating hydrological risk, GSF's effects for different risk levels may be mitigated.",
  "Since the enactment of Law No. 10,438 on April 26, 2002, some incentives have been created for alternative sources of electricity generation such as: (i) Proinfa, administered by the MME, which guarantees to eligible generators that Eletrobras will purchase the electricity generated for a period of 20 years and financial support from BNDES; (ii) reduced tariffs for use of electricity distribution and/or transmission systems (for production and consumption) at a discount of not less than 50%; (iii) special conditions for migration to the ACL with a load between 500 kW and 3 MW (known as 'special consumers', whose ceiling is currently 2MW, as per Ordinance No. 514 of 2018), provided that these consumers acquire electricity from generators that use alternative sources of  electricity,  thus  growing  the  consumer  market  for  these  producers;  and  (iv)  the  Electricity  Compensation System ( net metering ) for micro and mini generators connected to distribution systems.\nLaw No. 14,120 of 2021, arising from the conversion of Provisional Measure No. 998 of 2020, for new plants and for extended concession award periods, stipulates the end of discounted tariffs for using the distribution and/or  transmission  system  mentioned  in  item  (ii)  above.  Nevertheless,  the  aforementioned  law  stipulates transitional rules, so that companies that apply for a concession award or grant by February 2022 and that have all their generating units operating by February 2025, will be entitled to tariff discounts. The Law also stipulates that the Granting Authority shall set the guidelines for appraising environmental attributes of these sources by February 2022. The Tariff for Use of Distribution Systems ('TUSD') is charged to generators and free consumers for using the distributor's system to which a generator or free consumer is connected, and the tariff is adjusted annually to take into account variations in its components. TUSD comprises grid operation and maintenance costs, sector charges, investment remuneration and depreciation. Currently, TUSD consists of two parts, one known as 'TUSD Charges', depending on the electricity used, and the other called 'TUSD Wire', charged on contracted demand. A monthly charge per point connected, to be paid by the respective agent connected to the distribution system, is calculated by multiplying the amount (kW) by the tariff (R$/kW) set by Aneel.\nGeneration projects using alternative sources, subject to legal conditions, are eligible for TUSD discounts ranging from 50% to 100%, applicable to TUSD paid by both the generators, and consumers who purchase energy from these generators.\nDiscounts offered to alternative energy generators and their respective consumers are recognized separately by distributors and considered in tariff reviews or adjustments subsequent to granting the discount, so as to avoid any impact on the concessionaires' economic-financial balances.",
  "The Tariff for Use of Transmission Systems ('TUST') is paid by distributors, generators and free consumers for their use of the basic grid, and it is adjusted annually by Aneel to track: (i) inflation; and (ii) annual revenues allowed for transmission operators, including expansion costs determined by Aneel.\nAs per the criteria established by Aneel, owners of different parts of the transmission network transferred the duty of coordinating the operation of their facilities to the ONS, in exchange for receiving regulated payments from the transmission system's users. Grid users, including generators, sign contracts with the ONS that enable them to use the transmission network in exchange for paying its published tariff charges. HPP Itaipu has a transmission grid that is operated in alternating and direct current, which is not considered part of the basic grid or intermediate transmission system. The use of this system is remunerated by a specific tariff called  'Itaipu  Transmission',  paid  by  companies  holding  shares  in  the  energy  produced  by  HPP  Itaipu, proportionally to their shares. Holders of concessions or authorizations for using hydraulic potential must pay, as compensation for using water resources, 6.75% of the value of the electricity produced. Payment is due to the states, the Federal District and municipalities in which their operation is located, or which have areas flooded by water from the respective reservoir, and to entities belonging to the Federal Government's Direct Administration. The TFSEE was introduced by Law No. 9,427 of December 26, 1996 and regulated by Decree No. 2,410 of November  28,  1997.  In  2013,  it  was  modified  by  Law  No.  12,783/2013.  This  is  an  annual  fee  that  varies depending on the type of service charged in proportion to the size of the concession, permission or authorization (including independent energy production and self-production).\nThe  TFSEE  reaches  0.4%  of  annual  economic  benefit  received  by  a  concessionaire,  permission  holder  or authorized entity and must be paid directly to Aneel in twelve monthly installments. The RGR was created in 1957 by Decree No. 41,019 (revoked by Decree No. 10,810/2021) to provide the funds needed to reimburse agents when their concession is terminated or expropriated. As of February 1999, Aneel started  charging  a  fee  and  requiring  all  distributors  and  certain  generators  operating  under  public  services arrangements to make monthly contributions to the RGR, at an annual rate equivalent to 2.5% of the fixed assets of the operating company, but it must not exceed 3% of its total operating revenue in any given year.\nLaw No. 12,783 of January 11, 2013, released, as from January 1, 2013, the payment of the annual RGR: (i) concessionaires and distribution permit holders; (ii) transmission concessionaires auctioned as from September 12, 2012; and (iii) transmission and generation concessionaires which had their concession extended or which were subject to bidding processes under the terms of this law.",
  "The  CDE  was  created  to  support:  (i)  the  development  of  energy  production  throughout  Brazil;  (ii)  energy production from alternative  energy  sources (wind,  coal,  gas  and  biomass);  and  (iii)  social  objectives,  such  as universalizing energy services throughout Brazil, reducing the cost of electricity for low-income citizens, and preserving the coal industry in Brazil's Southern Region. The CDE is paid by all end consumers of energy through charges for using transmission and distribution systems.\nFor thermoelectric plants that use coal produced in Brazil, the aforementioned Law requires that the CDE be used to subsidize up to 100% of coal costs. As per the applicable legislation, there is a minimum quantity of coal that must be purchased by plants in order to ensure that Brazil retains certain levels of coal production. An important point to note is that legislation for the CDE states that new plants can be charged the CDE only if they have sufficient financial capacity to cover their respective additional expenses.\nAdditionally, plants fueled with Brazilian coal help to diversify energy sources in Brazil and prevent from the need to import coal, thus contributing to the balance of payments. It is important to highlight that the CDE is not a subsidy paid out by the public treasury, but a charge paid by all end consumers of electricity.\nOn April 19, 2022, Aneel published Resolution No. 1,016/2022 to determine procedures for reimbursing costs of fuel for generation projects using Brazilian coal, through the CDE. This resolution states that the fuel-cost criterion will depend on a generating plant's level of efficiency.\nFurthermore,  Aneel  Regulatory  Resolution  No.  1,016/2022  introduced  procedures  for  planning,  forming, processing and managing Coal and CCC portions associated with the CDE. Aneel Regulatory Resolution No. 1,016/2022 revoked Aneel Regulatory Resolution No. 801/2017, but maintained the fuel cost criteria based on a generating plant's efficiency level.\na.1.14.8) Contribution to Research & Development (R&D)\nDistribution, generation and transmission companies must invest at least 1% of their net operating revenue in R&D each year. SHPs, solar, wind and biomass energy projects are exempt from this requirement.",
  "The CCC is an economic subsidy paid by all energy consumers to cover the cost of fuel used for producing electricity in isolated systems. Law No. 12,783 of January 11, 2013 states that funds to cover these subsidies will henceforth come from the CDE sector fund, and no longer from directly charged quotas.\na.1.14.10) Energy Security Charges ('ESS-SE')\nESS-SE charges are used to fund thermoelectric plants dispatched for energy security reasons as a result of a decision made by the Electricity Sector Monitoring Committee ('CMSE').\nUntil March 2013, plants that were dispatched outside the order of economic merit were not included in the formation of the PLD spot price, and the corresponding costs were paid exclusively by load, that is, by distributors (with transfer to captive consumers) and free consumers.\nCNPE Resolution 03/2013 of March 6, 2013 changed the arrangements for apportioning these costs to include payment by other agents, generators and traders.\nAs from August 1, 2013, hydrological risk aversion mechanisms have been factored into models used to set PLD (discrepancy settlement price). Therefore, dispatch and price formation models tend to anticipate thermoelectric dispatch by incorporating the cost of these plants into the PLD. The CNPE continues to retain the prerogative of dispatching thermoelectric plants outside the order of merit, so as to ensure energy security. This additional cost is shared across all market agents in proportion to their amount of energy traded or sold.\nThis altered rule meant additional costs for generators and suppliers, who believe that they are undue, which prompted associations representing generators and suppliers to file  a  legal  challenge  against  the  new  rules. Generators  and  suppliers  are  exempt  from  this  charge  due  to  a  court  injunction  that  is  pending  final  and unappealable judgment. The 'New Electricity Sector Model Law' states that failure to pay the contribution to RGR, Proinfa, CDE, CCC, and other payments due for the purchase of electricity in the ACR or from HPP Itaipu, will prevent the defaulting party from receiving tariff adjustments (except for extraordinary revisions) or funds from the RGR, CDE or CCC.\na.1.15) Information on the gas transportation activity carried out by the jointly controlled subsidiary 'TAG'\nAdditionally, the Company operates in the natural gas transportation and storage segment in general through its jointly controlled 'Transportadora Associada de Gás S.A.' (TAG). For more details see item 6.5 of this Reference Form.",
  "The Company's environmental management considers the balance between its operations and environmental conservation, in order to reduce the impact for the environment and promote the sustainable use of natural resources,  guided  by  principles  and  guidelines  stated  in  the  Sustainable  Management  Policies  and  the Environmental Policy defined by the ENGIE Group, which are guided by Climate, Biodiversity, Water, Forests and Circular Economy aspects.\nOur Sustainable Management Policies and the Environmental Policy can be found on the Company's website (https://www.engie.com.br/investidores/governanca-corporativa/estatuto-social-codigos-e-politicas/).\nTo ensure compliance with these guidelines and promote adequate environmental management, the Company's integrated management system encompasses aspects of quality, environment and social responsibility, as well as occupational health and safety. This system's procedures, tools and environmental programs provide the basis for controlling risk and identifying opportunities for operational improvements in processes and services.\nThe Sustainable Management Policy ensures that electricity is produced in accordance with legal requirements common to all plants, or those specific for each business project. In addition, all stakeholders' communications concerning quality, environment, social responsibility, occupational health and safety and energy management are entered into the system and managed, so that they can be duly monitored and answered.\nThe  Preamble  to  our  Environmental  Policy  ratifies  the  Group's  adhesion  and  support  to  international environmental  protection  principles:  the  UN  Global  Compact  and  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  OECD Guiding Principles and the Paris Climate Accord.\nAdditionally, an important point to note is that the ENGIE Group has set itself ambitious global targets for 2030 known  as  'Non-Financial  Objectives',  such  as  reducing  water  usage,  lowering  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions, boosting production of renewable energy, biodiversity and other aspects.\nb.2) Integrated Management System Guidelines for Quality, Environment, Social Responsibility, Occupational Health and Safety, and Energy Management (SIG)\nEnvironmental, Maximize  energy  generation,  following  ONS  planning,  preserving  environmental conditions and ensuring safety for projects. = Generating  energy  in  compliance  with  safety  standards,  rational  use  and  preservation  of  natural  resources,  preventing  pollution  and  controlling  environmental risks, acting primarily in a preventive manner..

In 2023, ENGIE Brasil Energia obtained the recommendation for Recertification of the Integrated Management System - SIG in the NBR ISO 14001.2015 (Environmental Management System), NBR ISO 9001.2015 (Quality Management System) and NBR ISO 45001.2018 (Occupational Health and Safety) standards. Currently, ENGIE's portfolio  has  been  certified  for  80.9%  of  energy  generated  by  its  assets  in  2023.  Therefore,  the  Integrated Management  System  covers  11  power  plants  operated  by  the  Company.  In  addition  to  the  plants,  its headquarters are certified in accordance with these standards.\nThus, the certified Integrated Management System covers 11 plants and the headquarters.\nAdditionally, looking ahead to future certification, the Company is planning to implement a certifiable Integrated Management System for its wind power plants.\nThe ISO 14001 international standard sets the requirements for environmental management of an enterprise, in particular, assessing environmental aspects and their associated impacts, continuously improving the organization's  performance  in  prevention  and  control  of  pollution  in  compliance  with  the  environmental legislation, and management of emergency situations.\nAll plants in the Company's generating complex have the environmental authorizations and licenses required by the  relevant  entities,  complying  with  conditions  applicable  to  the  three  phases  of  the  project:  Preliminary Environmental  License  (LP)  (project  feasibility assessment),  Environmental  Installation  License (LI) and Environmental Operating License (LO).\nThe  Company  is  constantly  evaluating  and  adjusting  its  operations  and  procedures  in  order  to  meet  legal standards and fulfill the voluntary commitments made.\nb.6) Environmental Management Objectives, Goals and Programs\nIn  line  with  the  principles  of  its  Sustainable  Management  Policy,  the  Company  periodically  defines  its environmental objectives and goals, which give rise to Environmental Management Programs. The programs determine the initiatives to be developed, as well as the persons responsible for implementing actions, and their deadlines in order to enhance the environmental performance of its ventures as they develop their activities.\nb.6.1) Environmental programs and projects developed at the plants",
  "· Socio-environmental  studies  for  implementation  of  new  ventures: developed  within  the  scope  of environmental licensing to evaluate different aspects and possible social-environmental impacts, required for licensing processes before deploying new plants, focusing on terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna, quality of surface and underground waters and erosion, socio-economic environment and other issues. These studies are submitted for public consultation whenever necessary, as well as to the analysis by the relevant entities in order to ensure compliance with all material aspects for stakeholders. Additionally, a point worth noting is that environmental programs are continued throughout the useful life of projects, within the scope of the environmental licensing process.\n· Spring conservation program: the Company also develops spring conservation projects in partnership with government and third sector organizations. This program has already recovered more than 2,400 springs and has been nominated for some awards; at the end of the year, it was recognized as finalist for the Sustainable Bahia Seal awarded by the Government of the State of Bahia.\n· Promotion of biodiversity and environmental parks: as part of the environmental compensation required to deploy  projects,  the  Company  finances  and  supports  programs  and  partnerships  that  create  and  run environmental conservation units in order to conserve biodiversity in areas around its reservoirs, among which the following stand out:\n-Fritz  Plaumann  State  Park: located  in  Concórdia,  in  the  State  of  Santa  Catarina  (SC),  the  park  was implemented in partnership with private companies, the Santa Catarina Environmental Institute (IMA) and the  civil  society,  enabling  protection  and  use  of  the  most  important  area  of  the  remaining  Deciduous Seasonal Forest (Uruguay River's Forest).\n-Teixeira Soares Natural Municipal Park - Uruguay River Forest : the park is part of the environmental compensation for deploying HPP Itá and it is located in the municipality of Marcelino Ramos (RS). It aims at expanding protected areas through environmental education and adaptation of ecological and rural tourism activities, among other development projects integrated with environmental conservation objectives.\n-Jacob Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN) : located at Nova Ponte, in the State of Minas Gerais. This 358-hectare conservation unit was created in 1997 as part of the environmental compensation to implement HPP Miranda. A point worth mentioning is that ENGIE signed a partnership with the Instituto Estadual de Florestas (IEF) of Minas Gerais to develop the ASAS Project (Wild Animals Release Area) to receive  and  release  animals  leaving  Cetras  (Wild  Animals  Treatment  and  Rehabilitation  Center),  mostly species that have been victims of trafficking or mistreatment.\n-Vargedo  Farm : located  in  the  municipality  of  Castro,  State  of  Paraná,  it  is  considered  part  of environmental compensation for the Gralha Azul Transmission Line. Its goal is to recover degraded areas that total 228 ha within an area of just over 700 ha.\n· Environmental Publicity Center (CDA) at Itá HPP: located at Itá, in  the  State of Santa Catarina (SC), the educational projects developed focus on the community and include thematic exhibitions, library, videos and photographic  archives  containing  social  and  environmental  information  about  the  region  and  programs developed by the power plant.\n· Community relationship program: the Company is developing a series of relationship initiatives with local communities around its plants in order to show them our activities and inform them about environmental conservation and social development.\n· Biodiversity Matrix Program: ENGIE has mapped the status of biodiversity throughout the area of influence of its energy generating plants in Brazil. As an unprecedented initiative in the sector, the Biodiversity Matrix project presents an 'x-ray' of fauna and flora near the projects in five of the six Brazilian biomes: Atlantic Forest, Pampa, Caatinga, Pantanal and Cerrado. The objective is to help set the guidelines for environmental management in order to reinforce the protection of threatened species and ecosystems. In 2023, ENGIE Brasil Energia rolled out its program at the Miranda Hydroelectric Power Plant, in Minas Gerais, where the highlight was the development of an action plan 100% integrated with asset management tools in order to incorporate them into teams' management and operating routines.",
  "These planned initiatives became part of the biannual planning for the Jacob Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN), an important hub for relationships with various stakeholders in the region. Public visitation activities at the unit were reopened in 2023 and its research support program was reset through partnerships with educational institutions and regional and international researchers.\nAt the Campo Largo Wind Complex, the strategic evaluation and update of the project's action plan began at the end of 2023. One of the highlights of this review is the inclusion of International Union for Conservation of Nature  ('IUCN')  methodology,  used  for  determining  threatened  species  and  planning  ecological management to focus on Nature-Based Solutions ('SBN').\nIn order to adapt to new global guidelines on the topic, the program has been restructured and expanded, ensuring most robust governance and enabling a more effective analysis of its impact's materiality. Thus, it will  be  possible to qualify and quantify the Company's biodiversity footprint and enhance initiatives with positive impacts for several Brazilian biomes.\n· Reservoirs: The  reservoir  area  for  hydroelectric  power  plants  and  their  surroundings  are  the  legal responsibility  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries,  which  have  local  teams  for  environmental  and  social security surveillance purposes.\nFurthermore, the Company encourages the multiple use of these areas by the communities, establishing partnerships with municipalities  to  create  artificial  beaches,  areas  reserved  for  fishing,  motorboating  and other leisure activities, as well as irrigation for agriculture and livestock. These uses are evaluated considering the  current  environmental  legislation  and  the  guidelines  of  the  Environmental  Plan  for  the  Use  and Conservation  of  the  Surroundings  of  Artificial Reservoirs  ('PACUERA'),  which  is  prepared  by  the Entrepreneur and presented in a Public Consultation for subsequent approval by the Environmental Agency responsible for licensing the project in question. b.7.1) Emissions b.7.1.1) Management\nThe Company is constantly monitoring its Greenhouse Gas Emissions and, therefore, developing and applying various techniques, practices and processes to minimize them, such as:\n· disposal of ashes from the combustion of biomass (wood waste and sugarcane bagasse) that is retained in agricultural and forestry equipment.\n· implementation of a videoconferencing system in all plants  or regional units to  reduce  commuting and Greenhouse Gas Emissions.\n· preparation, since 2010, of a company-wide Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory as per Brazilian GHG Protocol guidelines, including third-party assurance of the document's contents. The 2023 inventory will be published in full on the Company's website as an annex to the 2023 Sustainability Report.",
  "In 2023, the Company's Scope 1, 2 and 3 of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions totaled approximately 672,000 tons - down 39% from 2022, mainly due to the sale of the Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Plant, whose data were collected only until its sale (May 2023). This initiative ensures ENGIE Brasil Energia's ranking as Brazil's leading generator of 100% renewable electricity, according to its ongoing strategy of prioritizing investments in more renewable energy source projects, such as wind and solar power plants and transmission infrastructure.\nThe Company is committed to improving corporate initiatives and strategies to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions through its structured Climate Journey Program, in addition to adapting practices and processes for the energy transition scenario. It is, therefore, striving to contribute decisively to slow climate change and its impacts, in line with the principles of the Paris Accord and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and, especially, the Group's ambitious commitment to reach NetZero Carbon by 2045.\nFurthermore,  the  Company  has  solutions  in  its  portfolio  to  support  other  organizations  on  the  path  to decarbonization. To this end, ENGIE offers Green Products to the market: Carbon Credits (CDM), Renewable Energy Contracts (ENGIE-REC) and Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs), which neutralize and/or offset GHG emissions from Corporate Emissions Inventories Scopes I, II and III.\nb.7.2) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)\nSince 2012, the Company has been obtaining registrations with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects comprising renewable, wind and solar energy generation assets. These projects are able to earn carbon credits (Certified Emissions Reduction CER) in the following annual totals:\n· Trairi: 42,630 CERs;\n· Guajiru: 56,411 CERs;\n· Mundaú: 45,705 CERs;\n· Flexeiras I: 51,048 CERs;\n· Santa Monica: 211,875 CER;\n· Campo Largo (phase I): 778,875 CER;\n· Campo Largo (phase II): 789,381 CER;\n· Umburanas: 992,458 CER;\n· Assú V: 45,893 CER; and\n· Santo Agostinho: 802,691 CER (project pending UNFCCC's full registration).\nIn 2023, the Company carried out its first issue of carbon credits for EBE's wind and solar projects totaling more than 4 million tons of CO2e avoided over the period from 2013 to 2020.\nb.7.3) Direct Energy Consumption b.7.3.1) Management\nThe Company's production process uses electricity partly generated in-house and partly from the SIN, especially during periods when plants are providing support for the SIN. Reactive support is one of the supplementary services  provided by  some  agents  for  the  SIN  that  are  known  as  'Ancillary  Services',  in  order  to  boost  the system's  quality  and  stability.  To  promote  this  support,  some  hydroelectric  power  plants'  generating  units operate as synchronous compensators on certain occasions by consuming active energy and simultaneously generating reactive energy support required by the system. Energy directly from fossil fuels is used mainly at our thermoelectric plants, as shown in the 'fuels' item.\nFossil  fuels  consumed  indirectly  for  electricity  arises  mainly  from  employees  transportation.  Therefore, management initiatives for energy consumption developed by the Company focus on measures such as more use of dual-fuel cars, prioritizing ethanol in its fleet of vehicles, and holding teleconferences in order to minimize employee travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.",
  "In 2023, the Company consumed 20.23 GWh of energy from the grid, which corresponds to 72.857 thousand GJ to operate the power plants of its generating complexes, to produce 43,184 GWh of gross electricity.\nb.7.4) Water b.7.4.1) Management\nThe Passo Fundo, Machadinho, Cana Brava, São Salvador, Estreito, Ponte de Pedra and Itá HPPs also have control over effluents from drainage wells, through a system that separates water from oil from the effluents generated in the engine room.\nThe Company has a system in place to use drainage water from the dam's inspection galleries at the Salto Osório, Itá and Machadinho HPPs, reducing the use of chemical products in water treatment at these plants.\nIt is worth noting that one of ENGIE Group's non-financial objectives, with a horizon of attainment in 2030, is the reduction by 70% of water consumption due to the energy produced, using 2019 as a reference base.\nb.7.5) Hazardous Waste b.7.5.1) Management\nHazardous waste management includes packaging, temporary internal storage, transportation and final disposal, in compliance with environmental licensing regulations, international treaty standards and other applicable legal requirements.\nThe Company adopts preventive measures against leaks - such as the use of safety data sheets for chemical products, the implementation of containment barriers and adequate vehicle signage - and only hires companies duly qualified and licensed within the national territory for this type of transport.\nb.7.6) Non-Hazardous Waste b.7.6.1) Management\nThe Company strives to reutilize, reuse or recycle its non-hazardous waste, in order to avoid the environmental impact of its disposal and extraction of new materials from nature.\nLight  and  heavy  ashes  resulting  from  the  burning  of  mineral  coal  to  generate  electricity  correspond  to approximately 95% of the total volume of waste destined in 2023.\nLight ashes are sold to the cement industry as an input, replacing limestone in the composition of pozzolanic cement.\nHeavy ashes are used as a base for asphalt paving on highways and to neutralize soil acidity in the recovery of coal waste deposits, due to its high pH.",

The latter do not require fossil fuels since they are fueled by wood waste (Lages Cogeneration Unit) or sugarcane bagasse (TPP Ibitiúva Bioenergética and TPP Ferrari), so their environmental impact is reduced by avoiding extraction of non-renewable natural resources and disposal of waste, while also reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions.",
  "In 2023, Engie's thermoelectric plant consumed 0.53 thousand GWh (1.92 million GJ) of fossil fuel, which was used only until May 2023, after which there were no more thermoelectric plants in the Company's portfolio. The Company continuously monitors areas around its reservoirs and develops programs to conserve flora and fauna.  Combined  with  management  initiatives,  these  programs  ensure  the  biodiversity  and  environmental conditions required for the conservation and development of species before, during and after reservoirs are filled.\nFurthermore,  the  Company  invests  in  Research  and  Development  projects  focusing  on  conservation  of endangered  species  and  environmental  education  initiatives,  raising  the  awareness  of  communities  and  the society in general regarding the importance of conserving the environment.\nThe Company's initiative of identifying areas around its projects in order to detect biodiversity conservation opportunities is worthy of note. During the construction of a hydroelectric power plant, the Company carries out the study and rescue of animals in  the  region  during  the  period  of  vegetation  suppression  and  formation  of  the  reservoir,  and  maintains preservation strips along its edges for the development of local flora and fauna. The process of chasing away and/or rescuing animals also occurs when other generation or transmission assets are implemented.\nSpecies that may be a focus for health problems that affect local populations are also monitored and controlled through periodic studies and surveys - including insects and snails that transmit diseases and venomous animals - and the Company is developing accident prevention programs. The  Company  monitors  the  flora  of  regions  where  it  operates,  collecting  seeds  and  flowers  to  be  studied, cataloging and subsequently producing seedlings, thus hoping to ensure the continuity of native species through reforestation  and  recovery  of  vegetation  and  riparian  zones  in  areas  surrounding  our  plants  and  local communities.\nThe Company's botanical gardens enrich forest replacement practices by recovering riparian strips or areas in general, in addition to being places for environmental education programs for visitors.",
  "Through ichthyofauna research projects, the Company seeks to understand the dynamic balance established during the formation and maturity of lakes to adopt specific management at each plant, minimizing this process' impacts  for  the  species.  A  standout  among  key  initiatives  developed  is  the  repopulation  of  rivers  through laboratory reproduction of fingerlings of native species.\nThrough Itá and Machadinho Consortiums, the Company is conducting joint research with the Freshwater Fish Laboratory (Lapad) of the Federal University of Santa Catarina ('UFSC'), reproducing fingerlings of endangered species in the region, such as 'piracanjuba', 'dourado', 'curimbatá' and 'piava', among others.\nIn 2017, our R&D project named 'Technology for the formation of germplasm banks and production of native fish for stocking (repopulation) in the Iguaçu River' was completed together with Aneel, which rated the project as 'excellent' due to the results achieved and the perspectives proposed.\nIn 2019, the Company started a new project to protect the ichthyofauna: 'Development of Control Techniques and Studies of the Pimelodus maculatus Species in the Suction Tube and Downstream of HPP Machadinho'. The project aims to study mechanisms to expand the possibilities of conservation of this species, considering the impacts arising from the Power Plant's operations. In December 2020, a new R&D project called 'Development and Application of Genetic Tools in Monitoring the Ichthyofauna of Hydroelectric Power Plants Reservoirs' was initiated. This project is a partnership between ATGC (startup and biotech incubated by the UFPR Innovation Agency) and ENGIE Brasil Energia. Its overall objective is to develop genetic/molecular tools using next generation sequencing, apply them for environmental monitoring and analysis of the ichthyofauna genetic structure at the reservoir of the São Salvador Hydroelectric Power Plant, in the State of Tocantins).\nb.7.10) Costs and investments in environmental management\nIn  2023,  the  Company  invested  R$27  million  in  the  implementation  and  maintenance  of  environmental protection  initiatives, installation of cleaner  technologies,  personnel,  control  of  atmospheric  emissions, environmental education and training, external certification, external environmental management services, and personnel allocated to general environmental management activities. Although specific human rights regulations in Brazil are not binding on companies, there is an increasingly strong trend towards the proliferation of new regulatory instruments stipulating the duties to be fulfilled by companies with regard to respect for human rights across all business strategies.\nResolution No. 5/2020 of the National Human Rights Council offers support for the stance that companies should take in relation to human rights, showing that companies are responsible for human rights violations due to their activities, which extends across their entire production chains.\nENGIE's operations are guided by best practices on this topic, including the UN's Guiding Principles on Human Rights and Business. The Company's commitments and guidelines for acting on and respecting human rights in its projects, operations and production chain are regulated by its Human Rights Policy. The  Company  depends  only  on  concessions  and  authorizations  from  the  Granting  Authority  to  conduct  its professional activities.

In addition to power plant employees, community leaders, educators, local suppliers and representatives of third sector entities and public bodies were asked to point out the positive and negative impacts of the Company's presence in each territory, as well as its potential contribution to sustainable development.\nHeld from August to November 2022, the Panels involved local communities located in the surroundings of eight hydroelectric power plants operated by the Company, in addition to its headquarters, gathering around 430 people. Along with the panels, individual interviews were conducted with other members of these communities - particularly public administrators, in order to expand listening. The process was coordinated by a specialized consulting firm - in order to ensure impartiality and balanced gathering of opinions.\nIt is worth noting that the sustainability panels are a recurring practice of the Company. In 2019, there was a broad dialogue process involving communities, with participation of some 600 people. In 2021, still under the impact of the pandemic, the activities involved 93 people from seven Brazilian states living next to nine projects of the Company.",

Additional  information  to  item  1.9  'In  relation  to  environmental,  social  and  corporate  governance  (ESG) information, indicate': Driven by the desire to positively impact people and the planet, ENGIE Brasil Energia has historically adopted social, environmental and governance policies and practices, which led it to be part of a group of companies that are a benchmark in sustainability in the country. In addition to the trust of stakeholders who share the Company's long-term vision and purpose, this benchmarking has been expressed through awards and recognitions received over the last few years - among which, the continued presence in B3's Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) since 2005 is a standout.\nENGIE Brasil Energia's Sustainable Management Policy guides its ESG performance on five fundamental fronts: Governance, Quality, Environment and Climate Change, Occupational Health and Safety and Social Responsibility. Derived from this Policy, corporate guidelines support the corporate sustainability agenda in a transversal way, anchored in ENGIE Group's Non-Financial Objectives, to be globally achieved by 2030 - in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, proposed by the United Nations Organization (UNO).\nThese objectives, publicly assumed in 2020, include aspects that are linked, particularly, to the generation of renewable energy, promotion of gender equality and initiatives against climate change, as described below:\n· Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: Reduce total greenhouse gas emissions from the Group's electricity generation to a maximum of 43 MtCO2e - in 2019, this total was 80 MtCO2e (goal aligned with the Science Based Target initiative - SBTi).\n· Gender Diversity: Increase the participation of women in the Group's Management to at least 40% - in 2019, they held 24% of leadership positions.\n· Renewable Energy: Increase the share of renewable sources in the mix of energy production capacity worldwide to 58% - compared to 28% recorded in 2019.\n· Supply Chain: Achievement of 100%, by 2030, of the responsible procurement index (excluding energy purchases),  which  involves  socio-environmental  assessments  and  inclusive  purchasing;  and  reaching 100%, by 2030, the top 250 preferred suppliers certified by Science Based Targets (SBTi) commitments.\n· Water: Achieve water consumption, in relation to energy produced, of 0.1 m3/kWh.\nDriven by  sustainability,  the  management  of  socio-environmental  and  governance  issues  is  shared  between different corporate areas that ensure the inclusion of ESG aspects in strategic plans on all business fronts. The Board of Directors supervises the topic through regular reports from the areas and the work of the Sustainability Committee, from which it receives updates on a half-yearly basis. In 2023, the Sustainability Committee had its composition  and  dynamics  restructured,  so  that  interaction  with  directors  can  be  even  more  effective.  The Sustainability Committee is coordinated by the Processes, People and Sustainability Officer.\nThe context of material sustainability topics is summarized in the corporate Balance Scorecard, based on all the elements described - Policies, Non-Financial Objectives, sustainable development frameworks and agendas, as well as Management guidelines, business perspectives and strategies. Thus, it results in strategic and tactical ESG commitments for all operating units, integrating the Company's annual objectives.",
  "Aware of the impacts of its supply chain, in 2023, ENGIE published the Code of Conduct in Supplier Relations. The document is based on the Code of Conduct already adopted by the ENGIE Group, with some adaptations applicable to the Brazilian context, serving as an instrument for extending the Company's ethical standards to the  value  chain.  As  set  out  in  the  guidelines,  any  potential  supplier  must  be  aware  of  and  familiar  with  the principles of integrity, compliance and data privacy, accepting contractual clauses on these topics, as well as on social responsibility and respect for the environment. Other commitments and expectations related to suppliers are indicated in the Supplies Policy.\nFor more details on the Supplies Policy see: https://www.engie.com.br/ institutional/codigos-e-politicas/\nThe Company also maintains mechanisms for evaluating and managing suppliers based on its Due Diligence Policy, which reflects the practices of the ENGIE Group, with measures that seek to mitigate risks of corruption and other violations of the Company's environmental and Human Rights policies. In summary, this dynamic predicts:\n· Ethical analysis before the onboarding of any new supplier, conducted through an automated platform with big data resources that covers, among other items, social and ethical aspects (including embargo measures for countries considered as posing risks under the terms of the Company's and ENGIE Group's Embargo Policy). Previous ethical analysis is reviewed for the entire supplier base annually.\n· Quarterly assessment of long-term suppliers or critical suppliers that provide services inside ENGIE Brasil Energia facilities, covering four approaches: commercial, social, environmental and health and safety. In cases of low performance, action plans are planned to address the identified correction and improvement points, with support and monitoring from the Company.\n· Assessment conducted by an independent external company and with more in-depth criteria for the 'top 50' suppliers that receive larger volumes of resources in the year, observing criteria such as: convictions for misconduct, association to slave labor, inclusion in lists of unsuitable or sanctioned companies, and processes linked to environmental violations, among others; and\n· Reputation monitoring through the 'RepRisk' tool, for two supplier profiles: long-term suppliers and those that receive more significant volumes of resources.\nIn 2023, the Company also carried out a survey among suppliers to expand the understanding of its ESG policies and practices. Based on questionnaires answered through a digital platform, and supported by the provision of evidence,  challenges  related  to  the  environment,  health  and  safety,  human  rights  and  ethics,  among  other aspects, were identified. The information collected for the survey, besides supporting risk mapping, results in a score that qualifies the suppliers in accordance to their alignment to the Company's values and commitments. These data also help understand each supplier's maturity level in relation to the ESG agenda and support planning the actions for these partners' continuous development.\nENGIE does not allow, under any circumstances, exploitation of child, forced or compulsory labor. The conduct expected from employees, suppliers and partners in relation to this topic is described in ENGIE Brasil Energia's Human Rights Policy and Code of Ethics, which are widely disclosed for all audiences and can be accessed on the Company's website.\nFor  more  details  on  the  Human  Rights  Policy  see:  https://www.engie.com.br/uploads/2019/07/PoliticaDireitos-Humanos-PT.pdf",
  "The Company seeks to be a social transformation agent by promoting actions and projects that provide quality of life and progress to the communities where it has assets. In addition to structuring projects with a national scope (Women of Our Neighborhood, Education Program, Culture Centers Network, Partnerships for Good and Social Wellbeing Program), the allocation of funds also takes into account local demands, which are mapped by actively  listening  to  the  communities.  On  this  basis,  the  planning  of  programs  and  financial  support  has  a participatory bias, based on principles such as transparency, ethics and cooperation. In 2023, approximately R$18.6 million was invested in more than 350 social-environmental projects distributed across 16 states, and the  largest  portion  of  these  investments  was  voluntary  and  not  related  to  the  licensing  process  and/or obligations.  The  actions  involve  the  Company's  own  funds,  as  well  as  funds  resulting  from  tax  incentive mechanisms  (Culture  Incentive  Law,  Sports  Incentive  Law,  Childhood  and  Adolescence  Fund,  Elderly  Fund, Pronon and Pronas/PCD).\nThe Company gives priority to the following types of social investment: (i) income generation; (ii) education; (iii) culture and; (iv) social welfare. In line with the guidelines of ISO 45.001, the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) system covers all operations, assets and employees, contributing to prevent, control, eliminate or reduce risks, ensuring legal compliance, and keeping teams duly oriented.\nENGIE Brasil Energia's OHS Management System integrates the stages of identification, assessment and control of hazards and risks in all processes, including the preparation of projects and implementation of new facilities. The  Risk  Management  Program  ('PGR'),  in  turn,  establishes  measures  and  guidelines  for  continuous, multidisciplinary and systematized actions with focus on mitigation.\nTraining on occupational safety topics is essential for employee engagement and continuous improvement of the Company's OHS performance. The Company also conducts cycles of internal audits and develops various awareness initiatives and tools.",
  "Launched in 2022, the Diversity & Inclusion Policy guides the actions developed and defines the structure of the broad culture of diversity. Basic Diversity & Inclusion training is mandatory for all employees, and addresses unconscious biases and attitudes that make the work environment more inclusive. By the end of 2023, 100% of the workforce had already undergone training actions.\nThe new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy, known as 'Be.U@ENGIE', seeks to ensure that ENGIE is a place where everyone can occupy space and reach their potential.

The Company's Board of Directors, at the meeting held on August 21, 2020, approved the issuance of redeemable preferred shares of the indirect subsidiary Novo Estado Participações ('NEP'), all book-entry, with no par value, without voting rights, with priority in the receipt of fixed dividends, in the total amount of R$500 million (R$477 million, net of issuance costs). The issuance took place on September 1, 2020. The shares give the right to participate in the dividends declared and distributed by NEP on a priority and cumulative basis. As from the semester immediately following the Transmission System's entry into operation, dividends will be allocated every six months. NEP does not have the obligation to distribute dividends before such event. The number of redeemable preferred shares issued totals  95,446,379,  subdivided  into  12  classes,  with  different redemption deadlines, with the redemption deadline for the last class being October 31, 2034. The issuance and redemption values per share are shown below:\nNovo Estado Participações S.A., Issue value per share = 5.2385. Novo Estado Participações S.A., Capitalized value per  share = 2.6192. Novo Estado Participações S.A., Capital reserve value  per share = 2.6192\nFor corporate purposes in the indirect subsidiary NEP, the total value of the issue was allocated partly as paid-in share capital, in the amount of R$250 million, and partly as capital reserve, in the amount of R$250 million. For accounting purposes,  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  practices  adopted  in  Brazil,  this  transaction  was  considered  a  debt instrument. Therefore, the total value of the issue was recorded as a non-current liability. There are no differentiated rights  between  preferred  and  common  shares  other  than  the  priority  in  receiving  any  payment  of  earnings  or distributions by NEP.\nNovo Estado, Yield = .

Another hypothesis of early maturity is when changes occur in the effective, direct or indirect control of the company that benefits from the credit without the bank's prior authorization. In addition to these, other events that affect the project's operating capacity, or that affect the guarantees provided to the bank, are also usually cases of early maturity.\nFurthermore, more comprehensive items such as a final and unappealable sentence due to child labor, slave labor or  crimes  against  the  environment  are  also  situations  that  entail  early  maturity  for  these  types  of  financial instruments.\nThe financial commitments established in loan and financing contracts are being fulfilled by the Company and its subsidiaries.

This variation mainly reflected the following factors:\n(i)  the  portfolio's  energy  generation  and  sales  were  down  R$338  million  (3.6%),  substantially  driven  by  the following negative effects: (i.i) R$343 million fall in revenue from energy sales contracts in the regulated and free markets, as a result of variations in the quantity of energy sold combined with average net sales prices; and (i.ii) R$ 17 million fall in remuneration on concession financial assets corresponding to the portion of the payment for  granting  the  Jaguara  and  Miranda  Hydroelectric  Power  Plants  concessions  for  energy  allocated  to  the Regulated Contracting Environment ('ACR'), due to inflation falling over the years in question. These effects were partly mitigated by (i.iii) a R$37 million increase in short-term market transactions, mainly at the Electricity Trading Chamber ('CCEE'). Additionally, there was (ii) a R$ 568 million (33.4%) fall in the transmission segment and (iii) a R$ 246 million (35.9%) fall in the trading segment arising mainly from reduced revenue from operations. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, operating costs reached R$4,841 million, which was R$1,476 million (23.4%) down from R$6,317 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. This variation reflected a combination  of  the  following  factors:  (i)  R$830  million  (72.8%)  lower  costs  in  the  transmission  segment, substantially  due  to  lower  construction  costs;  (ii)  R$409  million  (9.1%)  decrease  in  the  portfolio's  energy generation and sales segment; (iii) R$234 million (35.0%) decrease in energy trading costs; and (iv) R$3 million variation in costs of selling and installing solar panels as a result of the sale of EGSD.",
  "· Sales, general and administrative expenses: The Company posted a R$66 million YoY increase in sales, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 against the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The main variation arises from the generation segment, in the amount of R$62 million, which was substantially impacted by the following events: (i) higher advertising expenses due to its commercial strategy of seizing opportunities with the opening of the free market; and (ii) higher expenses incurred with outsourced IT, consulting and legal services.\n· Reversal  (provision)  for  asset  impairment,  net: In  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  the Company recognized the amount of R$ 1,243 million for reversal of impairment resulting from the sale of  the  Usina Termelétrica Pampa Sul S.A. subsidiary, and the amount of R$45 million in impairment provision for the loss at the Paracatu Photovoltaic Complex. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company (i) recognized the amount of R$21 million in impairment provision related to higher raw material supply costs at the Lages subsidiary; (ii) supplemented Pampa Sul's impairment in the amount of R$164 million; and (iii) reversed R$118 million related to EGSD's sale, which took place on February 21, 2022.\n· Sale of subsidiary: On May 31, 2023, having fulfilled precedent conditions, the sale of the Company's equity interest in the Usina Termelétrica Pampa Sul S.A. subsidiary was completed. As of that date, Pampa Sul was no longer controlled or consolidated by Engie. The result from this asset's sale, net of selling costs (negative R$1,296 million) and reversal of impairment (R$1,243 million), was negative by R$53 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to this transaction, the Company recorded revenue from disposal in the amount of R$9 million, arising from the price adjustment regarding the sale of the Diamante subsidiary in 2021 - this price adjustment arises from obligations conditioned for the receipt. On February 21, 2022 and September 1, 2022, the sale of equity interests that the Company held in the EGSD and Norte Catarinense subsidiaries was completed. As of those dates, these companies were no longer controlled or consolidated by Engie. The result from the sale of EGSD, net of selling costs (R$94 million) and reversal of impairment (R$118 million), was positive R$24 million. The result from the sale of Norte Catarinense, net of selling costs, was positive R$10 million.\n· Other operating (expenses) income, net: In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's generation segment recognized the amount of R$45 million as insurance indemnity resulting from the loss that occurred at the Paracatu Photovoltaic Complex, which was posted in 'other operating income'. Additionally, in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the amount of R$64 million recognized in the transmission segment had a negative effect on results, due to periodic tariff review against contract assets. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the transmission segment recognized the amount of R$20 million arising from positive price adjustment on the acquisition of Novo Estado Transmissora de Energia. This adjustment occurred after the 12-month period for measuring the business combination, which is  why it was recognized in the Company's results. In the fiscal year ended December 31, in addition  to  the  transmission  segment's  aforementioned  effect,  the  generation  segment  recognized negative  R$22  million,  which  substantially  refers  to  the  write-off  of  TPP  Pampa  Sul  assets  after maintenance works carried out in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.",
  "Equity  income  result  increased  by  R$266  million  (36.6%)  YoY,  from  R$727  million  in  the  fiscal  year  ended December 31, 2022, to R$993 million in the fiscal year ended December 2023. This increase reflected higher net income of Transportadora Associada de Gás - TAG, in which the Company had a 31.5% equity interest as of December 31, 2023. · Financial revenues: in the comparison between fiscal years, financial revenues fell R$136 million (23.2%), from R$585 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, to R$449 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, mainly due to a R$126 million fall in revenues from financial investments. This fall was substantially due to a lower average balance of financial investments YoY that was softened by a slightly higher CDI YoY.\n· Financial expenses: expenses fell R$560 million (23.6%), from R$2,373 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, to R$1,813 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. This was mainly due to a combination of the following effects: (i) R$527 million reduction in debt YoY, of which: (i.i) reduction of R$404 million in interest, mainly due to debt instruments settled for significant amounts during  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2023;  and  (i.ii)  reduction  of  R$123  million  in  monetary adjustment, due to variation in inflation, mitigated by increase in the balance of debt instruments.\n· Concession expenses payable (Use of Public Property): there was a YoY reduction of R$ 128 million, or 17.6%, from R$ 727 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, to R$ 599 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, as a result of the following effects: (i) R$ 155 million fall in monetary adjustment, mainly due to lower IPCA and IGP-M inflation indices, highlighting that the IGP-M in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 recorded deflation; and (ii) R$27 million increase due to concessions payable being updated to present value.",
  "Calculated YTD, income tax and social contribution (current and deferred) increased by R$ 347 million (55.9%), from R$ 621 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, to R$968 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The variation was mainly driven by higher income before income tax (IRPJ) and social contribution (CSLL). As a result of the abovementioned factors, net income in fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 was R$3,429 million, against R$2,665 million in fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

The net increase of R$1,248 observed between the years is mainly due to (i) increase in adjusted income before taxes; (ii) in crease in the receipt of RAP (Allowed Annual Revenue) for construction; (iii) positive variation in other liabilities; and (iv) reduction in income tax and social contribution payments. Net cash consumed by investment activities was R$2,042 and R$1,784 in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively. The net increase of R$258 between periods was mainly due to (i) higher investment in fixed assets and intangible assets, which was mitigated by (ii) reduced investment acquisitions; and (iii) higher dividends received from jointly owned subsidiaries. The net cash from financing activities was R$476 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The net cash consumed by financing activities was R$4,474 in the fiscal year ended in 2022.

The  price increase  between  the  periods  under  analysis  was  substantially  caused  by  monetary  restatement  of  current contracts, partly mitigated by proceedings from the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary, which sold energy at prices above the average price obtained by the rest of the Company's portfolio.\nThe amount of energy sold in contracts, net of trading operations, reached 35,816 GWh (4,088 average MW) in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 against 37,932 GWh (4,330 average MW) recorded in the fiscal year ended December 31 2022 - a decrease of 2,116 GWh (242 average MW), or 5.6%. The reduction in the amount of energy sold was caused by the reduced volume of sales to distributors, sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary and lower volume of purchases, and consequently, lower volume available for sale.\nLower  sales  volume  and  higher  average  selling  price  led  to  a  R$343  million  YoY  fall  in  the  Company's  net operating revenue - R$348 million referring to the 2Q23 sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary.",
  "Increase  of  R$76  million  (10.1%)  in  the  remuneration  of  concession  assets,  caused,  in  particular,  by  higher balances of contract assets smoothed by lower inflation indices. Concession financial assets represent the present value of future cash flows from the portion of energy allocated to  the  Regulated  Contracting  Environment  (ACR)  of  the  Jaguara  and  Miranda  Hydroelectric  Power  Plants, equivalent to 70% of the physical guarantee of these plants. These assets are remunerated at the internal rate of return and variation in the Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA). Remuneration of the concession's financial assets fell from R$485 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, to R$468 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, thus showing a decrease of R$17 million (3.5%). This variation was substantially due to the IPCA inflation index falling over the periods compared. Reduction of R$677 million (17.1%) in construction revenue, mainly arising from completing works at Gralha Azul and Novo Estado Transmission Systems.\n(ii) Factors that materially affected the operating results\nFactors that materially affected the Company's operating results in fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, are mentioned below. Additional details can be found in items 2.1.h and 2.2.a.(i). (i) reduced volume of energy purchases;\n(ii) recovery of energy costs, given renegotiated hydrological risk;\n(iii) reduced own fuel costs;\n(iv) increased gross result from the energy transmission segment;\n(v) increased earnings from equity interest in jointly owned subsidiary (TAG);\n(vi) recognized reversion of impairment , net.\nFurthermore, the abovementioned positive effects were partly mitigated by the following negative effects: (i) negative impact of the variation in the quantity of energy sold as a result of selling Pampa Sul; (ii) increased charges for using electrical grid and connection; (iii) increased selling, general and administrative expenses; and (iv) negative result from sale of subsidiary.",
  "(i) increased combination of variations in quantity of energy sold and average net sales price;\n(ii) reduced recognition of impairment between periods;\n(iii) reduced concession expenses to be paid due to lower adjustment indices;\n(iv) increased gross result from the energy transmission segment;\n(v) reduced own fuel costs;\n(vi) positive result of transactions carried out in the short-term market;\n(vii) higher result from equity interest in jointly owned subsidiary - TAG; and\n(viii) reduction of the negative result from the sale of subsidiaries.\nFurthermore, the abovementioned positive effects were partly mitigated by the following negative effects: (i) negative impact of renegotiating hydrological risk, given the positive effect recorded in 2021, with no effect in 2022; (ii) increased volume of energy purchases; and (iii) reduced revenue from concession financial assets. The Company's sales revenues are supported by contractual price adjustment clauses, mainly based on the IPCA and IGP-M. The Company's revenue does not have exposure to exchange rates that significantly affect its results, and it was not substantially affected by the introduction of new products and services.\nRegarding energy trading operations, the Company operates to obtain income from varying electricity prices within risk and counterparty limits that are predetermined by its Management.\nThe main variations in the Company's revenues due to changing prices and volumes are explained in item 2.2.a (i) above.",
  "c.1) Inflation and price variation in electricity sales costs\nEnergy purchases for portfolio management: these transactions are normally carried out through medium and long-term contracts, which have their prices adjusted by the IPCA and IGP-M. The average negative impacts referring to the price adjustment due to inflation indices were R$68 million and R$25 million, for the fiscal years ending on December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nElectricity grid usage and connection charges: calculated by multiplying the amount of grid usage in kW by the tariff  set  annually  by  Aneel,  based  on  apportionment  of  the  actual  and  expected  total  connection  and transmission costs for the entire system, and on IPCA and IGP-M adjustment indices for current transmission and connection contracts. The effect of these varying inflation indicators on the Company's costs was R$17 million and R$51 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively.\nFinancial  compensation  for  the  use  of  water  resources  ( royalties ): this  amount  corresponds  to  7.0%  of  the electricity produced and assessed by an Annualized Reference Tariff ('TAR') defined by Aneel that is based on the cost of acquiring energy by the distributor, to be reviewed every 4 years.\nFor the 2023 fiscal year, the TAR's 7.2% variation had a negative impact of approximately R$16 million on the Company's results. For the 2022 financial year, the TAR showed 10.2% variation with a negative impact of approximately R$21 million on the Company's results.\nc.2) Impacts of exchange rate, inflation and interest rates on the Company's financial results",

The Company's individual and consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 do not contain modified opinions or emphases in the reports of the Company's independent auditors. The Company's operating segments reflect its management, organizational structure and monitoring of results, as summarized below:\n· Generation: this is the Company's main business, comprising the portfolio's electricity generation and sale activities.\n· Transmission: the  Company  is  primarily  responsible  for  construction  and  installation  of  infrastructure related to transmission concession in the Gralha Azul, Novo Estado, Gavião Real and Asa Branca Transmission Systems, and it is exposed to risks and benefits arising from construction and operation of these assets.\n· Trading : this segment aims to obtain results from varying energy prices within predetermined risk limits. The activities in this segment are carried out by the ENGIE Trading and EBC subsidiaries.\n· Gas transportation: the Company also operates in the gas markets through its jointly owned subsidiary TAG. The Company's main operating segments are the generation and sale of electricity in its portfolio ('Generation'), electricity transmission ('Transmission') and electricity trading ('Trading').

Buyers will obtain full release from the corporate guarantee provided by ENGIE in relation to said debt. The Company's signing of the SPA was approved at its Board of Directors Meeting held on September 15, 2022.\nSince the sale value, net of costs, was less than the book value of the subsidiary's net assets in 2022, a R$191 million impairment provision was recognized in investments in the consolidated entity, with R$168 million in the parent company. However, due to signing of the SPA for sale of the plant on September 30, 2022, the Company reversed impairment it had recognized in the amount of R$43 million.\nOn May 31, 2023, having met precedent conditions, the Company concluded the sale of its shareholdings in the Pampa Sul subsidiary. As of that date, Pampa Sul was no longer controlled or consolidated by ENGIE.

  "The Company uses such measurements because it believes that they represent the metrics usually used by investors in general to diagnose and analyze the Company's operations. Furthermore, it uses such metrics to guide  the  actions  of  the  Company's  Management  with  the  aim  of  maximizing  its  financial  and  operational performance, as well as the profitability of the equity interest held by the Company's shareholders. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are the financial indicators used to evaluate the Company's results without the influence of the Company's capital structure and tax effects.\nBecause financial expenses and revenues, income tax and social contribution (current and deferred), depreciation and amortization and non-recurring transactions are not considered for its calculation, the Company understands that the Adjusted EBITDA is the most appropriate indicator for analytical purposes, as it works as a general performance measure by approximating the cash generation of its economic activity. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA works as a significant tool to periodically compare operational performance and to support certain administrative decisions. Adjusted EBITDA allows a better understanding not only of financial performance, but also  of  the  ability  to  meet  liabilities  and  obtain  funds  for  capital  expenditures  and  working  capital.  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, however, have limitations that hinder their use as measures of profitability, as they do not consider certain costs arising from business that could significantly affect profits, such as financial expenses, taxes, depreciation, capital expenses and other related costs.\nThe Company understands the Adjusted EBITDA Margin to be an appropriate measurement for understanding its financial condition because it measures the Company's operating profitability.",

It is composed of officers and managers of different departments.\n· Tactical Innovation Center: It approves investments in incremental innovations and monitors innovation contexts,  including  new  technologies,  market  information,  potential  customers  and  regulatory  updates.  It  is responsible  for  disseminating  the  innovation  culture  at  ENGIE  and  approving  criteria  for  evaluating  ideas submitted through INOVE, the Company's intrapreneurship program. The Center is staffed by employees of different departments and positions.\n· Innovation, Research and Development Coordination: A team exclusively dedicated to the innovation, research and development, with professionals from different academic backgrounds, which coordinate related initiatives, such as those involved in the INOVE Program, the Aneel PDI Program, Open Innovation, the framing of projects in the law known as 'Lei do Bem', management of intellectual property and royalties, promotion of internal awards ('Re-Conhece' Awards), and international awards for the group (One ENGIE Awards).\nIn 2023, ENGIE Brasil Energia actively participated in Public Consultation No. 12/2023, related to the Five-Year Strategic  Innovation  Plan  -  PEQuI  2023-2028 of the Aneel's Research, Development and Innovation (PDI) Program. According to the provisions of Law No. 9,991/2000, companies in the electricity sector are required to allocate 1% of their annual net operating revenues to PDI activities.\nIn addition to participating in town hall meetings and workshops related to the Public Consultation, the Company submitted contributions and held discussions with associations representing Energy Transmission Companies (ABRATE) and Independent Energy Producers (APINE) about joining efforts towards developing proposals.",
  "In 2023, ENGIE Brasil Energia was awarded two innovation patents. The first is for the 'Method for thermal imaging of a generator stator using distributed sensors', developed in partnership with the Federal Technological University of Paraná. The invention ushered in a new way of monitoring the temperature of the stators, using optical sensors. Thermal imaging allows the early identification of hot spots and possible failures in the stator insulation, which increases operational availability and avoids maintenance costs, as well as prolonged machine downtime.\nThe second patent awarded was for the 'System and method for determining the efficiency of three-phase induction motors (MIT) in operation', developed together with the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) and the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFSC). The equipment is capable of estimating the value of energy losses in three-phase electric motors, without taking them out of operation, that is, the method is non-intrusive. The information generated supports decision-making on the energy efficiency of engines. An ENGIE Brasil Energia project developed through the Aneel's PDI program won the 29th Expressão de Ecologia Award 2022/2023, in the Technology category. With an investment of around R$6 million, a software product unprecedented on the market was developed aimed at protecting the ichthyofauna around hydroelectric plants. The software was integrated into the operating system of the Machadinho Hydroelectric Plant, where the pilot project was carried out, to monitor the activity and volume of biomass of the yellow-spotted fish in the Plant's suction tube.\nAnother relevant fact was that the Company started to receive royalty payments due to the sale of domestic wind turbines developed in partnership with WEG and Centrais Elétricas de Santa Catarina (Celesc), through another Aneel PDI project. With a rated output of 4.2MW, the machine is the first domestic wind turbine and was ENGIE's largest R&D project in Brazil-approximately  R$80  million  was  invested  by  the  Company.  The forecast  is  that  more  than  R$8  million  in  royalties will  be  received  in  the  coming  years  for  the  Company's participation in the development of the technology.\nThe royalties received in 2023 are related to 17 wind turbines installed in Brazil in 2022. In addition to confirming the strategic value of innovation for generating value, the initiative proved beneficial to all market players that use the solutions developed, such as the chain involved in the design, testing, implementation and operation of wind power plants in the country.",

There are other additional risk factors, which may have effects similar to those of the risks listed below. Risks can materialize individually or cumulatively.\nThe order in which the risks are presented, within each category, seeks to take into account, in descending order, the  relevance  of  the  risks,  although  such  order  may  vary  both  as  a  result  of  the  severity  and  the  possible occurrence of a given risk. The presentation order has no relation to the relating probability of occurrence of any of the risks set out in this document.\nFurthermore, notwithstanding the subdivision of this section 4. Risk Factors, certain risk factors that may be in a subsection may also apply to other subsections of section 4.",
  "The  Company  may  not  be  able  to  obtain,  maintain  or  renew  in  a  timely  manner  the  necessary  licenses, registrations, enrollments and authorizations from or with government  authorities and distribution concessionaires for the conduct of its business or otherwise face material delays to obtain/renew them.\nThe  Company  depends  on  obtaining  various  licenses,  registrations,  enrollments  and  authorizations  for  the conduct of its business, including, but not limited to, licenses for Hydroelectric Plants, Small Hydroelectric Plants (PCHs), Wind Generation Plants (CGEs) and Photovoltaic Solar Energy Plants (UFVs), as well as authorizations from the National Electricity Agency (Aneel) and the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), and environmental licenses from municipal, state and federal environmental agencies, and it may have difficulties in obtaining new approvals, licenses and/or authorizations or renewing existing ones in compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to its business.\nLicenses, registrations, enrollments and authorizations require, among other things, the Company periodically report  on  its  compliance  with  rules  and  any  conditions  stipulated  by  the  relevant  agencies.  In  addition,  the Company is subject to inspections conducted periodically by such agencies with aim of determining whether the obligations set forth in the applicable regulations are being met. The Company may not be able to meet the conditions  required  for  it  to  maintain  or  keep  such  licenses,  registrations,  enrollments  and  authorizations. Furthermore, if, in the context of such inspections, any noncompliance by the Company with the applicable rules is  found,  then  the  licenses  necessary  for  the  Company's  activities  may  be  revoked  or  suspended,  and  the Company will be subject to fines and the imposition of other administrative penalties. Any failure to obtain, maintain or timely renew such licenses, registrations, enrollments and authorizations may result in the Company being prevented from implementing and/or carrying out its activities, consequently making a negative impact on its results.\nFor environmental licenses, authorizations and other documents, specifically, any failure to obtain, cancel or renew them in a timely manner may subject the Company to criminal and administrative sanctions (including fines and partial or total suspension of activities), without prejudice to the obligation to repair any environmental damage caused at the civil level, so the Company's financial results, results of operations and image may be adversely affected. For additional information on environmental licenses, authorizations and other documents, see risk factor ' The Company and its subsidiaries may fail to meet with the conditions set out in the environmental licenses of their projects or be unable to secure or correct the licensing of any projects that may be acquired. '\nThe  construction,  expansion  and  operation  of  electricity  generation  plants  and  transmission  lines  involve significant risks that can lead to loss of revenues or increased expenses.\nThe construction, operation, maintenance and expansion of facilities and equipment dedicated to the generation and transmission of electricity are subject to a series of risks, which include, but are not limited to:\n· inability to obtain government permits and approvals;\n· unavailability of equipment;\n· unavailability of distribution and/or transmission systems;\n· interruption of supply;\n· work stoppage, strikes and other labor disputes;\n· social unrest;\n· hydrological and climatic interferences;\n· political and judicial interference;\n· unexpected engineering and environmental problems;\n· delays in construction and start-up or unforeseen cost overruns;\n· changes to currently existing subsidies;\n· need for high capital investments;\n· unavailability of adequate financing; and\n· legal and regulatory changes.\nIf the Company is faced with any of these or other risks not mentioned above materializing, it may not be able to generate and/or transmit electricity in quantities compatible with its business plans, which may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nDams are important generation assets for the Company's business, as they store the majority of its energy generation capacity in reservoirs. Any failures in these structures, including the collapse of a dam, may result in losses and damages to third parties and the Company's business.",
  "Several factors can contribute to an increased risk of dam failures, negatively impacting the Company's business. Lack of suitable maintenance is a crucial factor that can lead to a dam failure. Lack of regular inspections, repairs and upgrades can result in wear and tear of the dam structure over time. Furthermore, aging facilities and lack of  investment  in  improvements  also  increase  the  risk  of  structural  failures.  This  negligence  can  expose  the Company to significant environmental and social damages, as well as potential financial losses and negative impacts on its reputation.\nAdditionally, there are external factors of risk of collapse inherent in the structures that may arise from climatic factors or result from damages to projects owned by other agents located upstream on the same river. Therefore, the Company is subject to the possible risks of collapse events that, if they occur, could result in social damages, and  potential  loss  of  human  lives  in  communities  close  to  the  assets,  as  well  as  environmental,  regulatory, economic and reputational damages.\nLack of planning and preparedness for emergency situations, including, but not limited to, lack of appropriate employee training, absence of efficient warning systems, and lack of effective communication with authorities and the local community, can hamper a quick and effective response in the event of an emergency, increasing the damage caused by a dam collapse.\nIf any dams fail, for internal and/or external reasons, the Company may suffer negative adverse effects on the reputational, operational and financial levels, as it may be forced to shut down the generating units for long periods, which may require expensive repairs.",
  "The Company's ability to fulfill its business strategy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to:\n· expand its energy generation and transmission assets;\n· grow with financial discipline;\n· optimize its customer portfolio;\n· achieve operational efficiency; and\n· keep its regulatory commitments.\nOnce new concessions have been obtained, the Company still has to seek financing for the construction of projects or for investments in construction on additions and replacements. The Company cannot ensure that any of these and other objectives essential to the business plan will be fully achieved. If the Company is not successful in implementing its business strategy, then its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is liable for any losses and damages caused to third parties as a result of failures in electricity generation  from  its  plants  or  interruptions  or  disturbances  not  attributable  to  any  identified  agent  in  the electricity sector.\nAccording to the laws of Brazil, the Company, as a utility service provider, is strictly liable for any direct and indirect losses resulting from inadequate provision of services, such as (i) losses and damages caused to third parties as a result of failures in the operation of its plants leading forced outages, interruptions or disturbances to the distribution and/or transmission systems or (ii) interruptions or disturbances that not attributable to any identified agent in the electricity sector. This means that the Company may be held liable for any damages, regardless of negligence or willful misconduct.\nIf  the Company is held liable for losses and damages resulting from failures in electricity generation from its plants  or  interruptions  or  disturbances  not  attributable  to  any  identified  agent  in  the  electricity  sector,  any indemnities will  result  in  a  cash  disbursement  by  the  Company,  which  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the conduct of business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nThe  Company  may  incur  additional  costs  associated  with  the  pension  plan  it  maintains  for  its  employees, causing an adverse effect on its financial condition.\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit supplementary pension plans ('BD Plans') through PREVIG - Sociedade de Previdência Complementar, which are closed to new members, and whose participants are mainly retirees who have already started enjoying benefits, as well as participants who opted for the proportional benefit.\nThe DB Plans sponsored by the Company pose a risk arising from the non-materialization of the assumptions used in actuarial calculations, namely, the life expectancy of participants and fluctuations in interest rates.\nIn the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, the amount of liabilities recognized as relating to postemployment  benefits  under  the  Company's  responsibility  was  R$400  million  and  corresponded  to  the  net liabilities  assessed  by  actuaries.  Out  of  the  total  amount  of  actuarial  liabilities,  R$278  million  correspond  to contracted debts.\nIf the Company should have to record actuarial losses as a result of any change in actuarial assumptions, discount rates or accounting practices, then its equity and financial position may be adversely affected.",
  "The authorizations that the Company and its subsidiaries hold for projects already awarded by the Aneel and the MME do  not  provide  any  present  or  future  guarantee  of  a  favorable  consumer  market  for  the  electricity produced. Electricity prices are influenced by fluctuations in the energy market, which are mainly affected by hydrology  and  energy  supply  and  demand.  The  expansion  of  electricity  production  in  the  Brazilian  system depends  on  future  demand  from  consumers,  which  may  not  materialize  or  be  lower  than  expected  by  the Company and its subsidiaries. Furthermore, any increase in demand, even if as expected or greater, may be supplied  by  competitors  or  by  other  electricity  generation  projects,  such  as  thermal  generation  and  large hydroelectric plants, which are already in operation or will come into operation in the future.\nConsequently, sales of electricity at planned prices are subject to the existence of the corresponding demand from  the  consumer  market,  represented  mainly  by  consumers  in  the  Free  Contracting  Environment  (ACL), electricity traders and electricity distributors. If the Company and its subsidiaries are unable to sell all the energy generated or, even if they do sell all of it, they cannot reach the expected prices, they may face a significant decrease in their estimated revenues. That can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations and, consequently, the general results of the Company.\nAny decisions unfavorable to the Company, its subsidiaries and/or its management in judicial, administrative or arbitration proceedings can adversely affect it.\nThe Company is, and may be in the future, a defendant in judicial, administrative and/or arbitration proceedings in civil, tax, labor, corporate, regulatory, competition, criminal and environmental matters, among others. The Company cannot ensure that the outcome of those proceedings will be favorable thereto or that it will maintain a provision, in full or in part, sufficient to cover all liabilities that may arise from these proceedings. Any decisions contrary to the Company's interests that may prevent the conduct of its business as initially planned, affect its reputation  or  interests  that  of  its  management  or  subsidiaries,  its  ability  to  contract  with  governmental authorities or obtain substantial amounts, especially when a provision has not been made or has been, but is not sufficient, may have adverse financial, operational and reputational effects on the Company, including the market value of its shares.\nAny judicial or administrative decisions against the Company may restrict its operations and the use of its funds, which  may  impact  the  fulfillment  of  the  Company's  obligations  to  third  parties.  Any  decisions  against  the Company may also involve amounts for which provisions may not have been made and require relevant financial resources. The occurrence of any of these risks may materially and adversely affect the Company and its financial situation and image. Finally, in addition to the costs of legal fees for defending those cases, the Company may be forced to post bonds in court in connection with such proceedings, which could affect the Company's financial capacity.\nFor a detailed discussion of the relevant judicial, administrative and arbitration proceedings, see sections 4.4 to 4.7 of this Reference Form.\nPart of the Company's assets is linked to the provision of utility services. These assets will not be available for liquidation in the event of bankruptcy, nor may they be pledged as collateral for the enforcement of court decisions.\nAccording to the applicable laws, a large part of the Company's generation and transmission assets are linked to the provision of utility services. These assets will not be available for liquidation in the event of bankruptcy or to be pledged as collateral for the enforcement of court decisions, and such assets must be reverted to the granting authority  if  the  concession  ends  or  is  terminated,  according  to  the  applicable  laws.  These  limitations  may significantly  decrease  the  amounts  available  to  the  Company's  shareholders  and  creditors,  while  having  a negative effect on the Company's ability to obtain financing.\nThe Company's insurance policies may not be sufficient to fully cover liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of the Company's business, and necessary insurance coverage may not be available in the future.",
  "The Company cannot guarantee that the coverage of the policies it has contracted will be sufficient to fully cover any liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of its business or that the necessary insurance coverage will be available in the future. If any of the uninsured events occurs, the paid-in investment may be lost. Furthermore, there are certain types of risks that may not be covered by their policies, such as, for example, war, acts of God, force majeure or interruption of certain activities, which, in the case of an accident involving said risks, may have a negative financial and operational impact on the Company's business.\nFurthermore, the Company and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain, in the future, insurance policies on the same terms as the current ones.\nConsideration for a Small Hydroelectric Plant (PCH) contracted under the Incentive Program for Alternative Sources of Electricity (Proinfa) and not participating in the Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE) depends on hydrological conditions in the region where the PCH is located.\nThe consideration for the sale of electricity by PCHs not participating in the MRE depends on the generation recorded for the previous year, which, in turn, depends on the natural energy flowing into the hydroelectric plant in which the PCH is located.\nAny failure of expected hydrological conditions to occur could result in generation being compromised, which could adversely affect the Company's future revenues.",
  "According to MME data, more than 70% of the effective electricity supply of the National Interconnected System (SIN) is generated by hydroelectric plants. Since the SIN operates in a dispatch system optimized and centralized by the ONS, each hydroelectric plant, including those of the Company, is subject to changes in climatic and hydrological conditions observed both in the geographic region where it operates and in other regions of the country.\nThe  occurrence  of  unfavorable  hydrological  conditions,  together  with  the  obligation  to  deliver  the  physical guarantee, may result in the Company's exposure to the short-term energy market, where prices may be high, which may negatively affect the Company's future results of operations, as well as the market value of the securities issued by the Company.\nAlmost all of the Company's hydroelectric generation capacity is included in the MRE. The MRE reallocates electricity on the basis of accounting, transferring the surplus electricity from those having generated in excess of their physical guarantee to those having generated below theirs. If hydroelectric generation is lower than the total physical guarantee of plants participating in the MRE, that characterizes a generation shortfall, which is then prorated among MRE participants, which may cause the Company to be exposed to the short-term market and have an impact on its business.\nThe development of new electricity generation projects by the Company and its subsidiaries depends on the future scenario involving costs, demand, production, energy prices, regulations, technological evolution and the output capacity of the National Interconnected System ('SIN'), which may differ significantly from the current market scenario.\nThe investments made by the Company and its subsidiaries in new energy generation projects are based on scenarios that take into account such variables as demand, transmission costs, distribution costs, and electricity production and prices. Such variables and estimates can materialize in manners different than expected, having an unfavorable impact on the making of new investments with attractive returns. The projection of unfavorable future scenarios can mean a change of focus by the Company on the development of new projects, which may preferably opt to acquire operational projects with energy contracted in the short and medium terms instead of developing greenfield projects.\nAdditionally, the Company and its subsidiaries, during the implementation of new projects, may incur additional costs or unbudgeted costs in connection with the construction of such projects, which may have an adverse effect on the financial situation of the Company and its subsidiaries. Such additional costs may also arise due to unexpected situations, such as port closures, excessive rainfall, events of force majeure and others that may change prices for the inputs, services and equipment necessary for the implementation of new assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nFinally,  for  the  development  and  implementation  of  new  renewable  energy  projects,  the  Company  and  its subsidiaries depend on the existence of a margin of output through the SIN in the locations where their projects\nare located, so that they can request the necessary authorizations to use the system. The recent scenario of growing solar and wind generation projects has culminated in structural requirements for access to the power grid, which can aggravate the risk that new projects may have limited output capacity or difficulties obtaining an opinion on access with connection feasibility, so as to impact energy trading activities. In such a context, if the Federal  Government,  through  the  MME  and  the  Aneel,  fails  to  implement  structuring  connection  measures necessary for the output of electricity to be generated by new projects, then the Company and its subsidiaries may see themselves prevented from making their new projects viable due to the absence of transmission and distribution  structures,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  financial  situation  and  results  of operations of both the Company and its subsidiaries.\nInsufficient  wind  caused  by  natural  factors  may  result  in  less  wind  generation  than  contracted,  negatively impacting the Company's results.\nThe Company is exposed to the possibility of insufficient wind caused by natural factors. An extended period of wind shortage could result in less energy being generated than contracted, which can have negative impacts on the Company's results of operations.\nThe growth of the Company's business and operations can be adversely affected if new energy purchase and sale agreements are not obtained in the ACL.",
  "The Company's business plan contemplates obtaining new contracts in the ACL, in which any participant, be it a generator, self-producer, supplier or consumer, when the requirements set out for their participation in the ACL are met, can work on the scheduling and contracting of amounts of electricity at any time, for any supply period, irrespective of government action, and can therefore compete with the Company and its subsidiaries for new contracts.\nIf the Company or its subsidiaries are unable to negotiate new contracts in the ACL, their revenues may decrease, which could materially adversely impact their growth and results.\nThe Company can be adversely affected by difficulty in obtaining necessary funds through transactions in the capital or credit market.\nTo obtain funds for its activities, including projects recently acquired and/or developed by the Company, the Company seeks to obtain financing from financial and development institutions. Its ability to continue obtaining such financing or to obtain it on favorable terms depends on several factors, including the Company's debt level and market conditions.\nAdditionally, the market for securities issued by Brazilian companies, as well as the supply of credit to Brazilian companies, is influenced, to varying degrees, by the global economy and market conditions, in particular by Latin American countries and other emerging markets. Investor reactions to events in these countries may have an adverse effect  on  the  market  value  of  securities  of  Brazilian  issuers.  Crises  in  Brazil  and/or  other  emerging countries or the economic policies of other countries, in particular the United States, can reduce investor demand for securities from Brazilian companies, as well as the supply of credit to Brazilian companies. Additionally, any significant volatility in the domestic and global credit and capital markets and/or unavailability of financing in the domestic and global credit and capital markets at reasonable rates can make a material adverse impact on the financial market, as well as the domestic and global economies.\nIf the Company is unable to obtain the necessary funds or to obtain them on reasonable terms, then the Company may have difficulty implementing and completing the planned investments in its fixed assets, and the operation and development of its business may be adversely impacted.",

  "TAG is  a  jointly  controlled  subsidiary  of  the  Company  and  is  not  consolidated  in  its  financial  statements, according to the applicable accounting practices.\nSince 2019, the Company has held joint control of Transportadora Associada de Gás (TAG). Given that joint control, the Company does not consolidate TAG's results in its financial statements. Therefore, the investment is accounted for at cost and subsequently recognized by the equity method. The earnings of the joint venture are recognized in the 'equity pick-up' line in the individual and consolidated income statement, while changes in other comprehensive income are presented as part of the Company's other comprehensive income.\nIn this context, the investment in TAG may sustain an impairment which is calculated as the difference between , the jointly controlled subsidiary's recoverable value and book value. Furthermore, the goodwill related to TAG is\nincluded in the book value of the investment and is therefore neither amortized nor impairment-tested as a separate asset.\nAdditionally, through TAG, the Company began to do business in the gas transportation segment, which involves the construction, expansion, operation and maintenance of gas pipelines, facilities and equipment. The risks arising from this business segment include:\n· unavailability of gas transportation systems;\n· interruption of supply;\n· unavailability of equipment;\n· unexpected engineering problems and social and environmental problems;\n· construction and operation delays or unexpected cost overruns;\n· regulatory changes;\n· changes in existing tax incentives;\n· strikes and other labor disputes, especially related to key suppliers;\n· social unrest in the spheres of influence of its gas pipelines.\nIf TAG comes across any of these or other risks, it may not be able to fulfill its gas transportation agreements, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally,  TAG  has  gas  transportation  service  agreements  with  Petrobras  representing  81%  of  its  net operating revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, so the majority of TAG's revenues come from a single customer. Accordingly, TAG may not be able to operate under the contracts entered into due to events that are beyond its control, and Petrobras may attempt to cancel or renegotiate its agreements. TAG's inability or Petrobras' inability to fulfill its respective contractual obligations could have a material negative effect on TAG and, consequently, on the Company.\nFurthermore, Petrobras may terminate these agreements early in the cases contemplated therein or not renew them as they expire. There is no assurance that TAG will obtain equivalent revenue from its other customers in the future. If TAG is unable to renew its agreements with Petrobras or to obtain new contracts or if new contracts are concluded for amounts substantially lower than those in place or on less favorable terms than those of existing agreements, TAG's results of operations and financial results may sustain a material adverse effect, and, consequently, so may those of the Company.\nTAG may also be materially adversely affected if a deterioration in Petrobras' business or financial condition, including as a result of operational or financial problems in the exploitation and production of its reserves, does not allow it to fulfill its obligations under its agreements with TAG. If Petrobras fails to comply with the terms of such agreements, TAG may have its cash flow and operations compromised and sustain a material negative impact on its financial conditions and results, consequently affecting the Company.\nIn addition, Petrobras is currently controlled by the Federal Government of Brazil and may be influenced by political factors when meeting its obligations under its agreements, which may materially adversely affect TAG.

The Company can also be held liable for bodily injury  or  death  of  third-party  employees  inside  its  facilities,  which  could  adversely  affect  its  reputation  and business.\nCivil  liability  for  environmental  damages  is  strict  and  joint  in  nature.  In  this  scenario,  all  of  those  having contributed to the occurrence of environmental damages can be held liable for redressing them, regardless of the existence of willful misconduct and/or negligence. Therefore, civil liability can apply to all parties involved in the activity having caused environmental damages, so that the party having more financial resources can be required to redress them and is reserved the right of recourse against the others involved.\nTherefore,  any  environmental  damages  and/or  damages  to  third  parties  caused  by  any  service  providers performing activities contracted by the Company and/or its subsidiaries, especially inside their facilities, will expose the Company to joint and several liability for redress and/or compensation for the damages caused, including the possibility of the Company being joined as a defendant in legal proceedings seeking redress or compensation for damages caused to the environment and/or third parties. Depending on its involvement in the offense, the Company will also be exposed liability at the administrative and criminal levels. If the Company is held jointly and severally liable for any environmental damages caused by its suppliers or third-party contractors, then its financial results, results of operations and image can be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the Company may be questioned in court or by administrative agencies about the recognition of employment relationships with employees of third-party service providers hired by the Company or be held contingently liable for any labor and social security obligations not duly paid by its third-party service providers, which could result in a substantial increase in the Company's liabilities and consequently have a material adverse effect on its economic capacity and financial results.\nAny delays or failures to provide services by any construction companies hired by the Company or to supply any machinery and equipment can have an adverse effect on its image and business.\nThe Company outsources the construction services it needs to develop its projects and purchases the necessary machinery and equipment from third parties. Accordingly, the timeframe and quality of the projects in which the Company participates  depend  on  third  parties.  Construction  outsourcing  can  influence  the  identification  of delays and failures and consequently influence their correction. Any failures, delays or defects in the services provided by such construction companies hired by the Company, as well as in the supply of any purchased\nmachinery or equipment, can have a negative effect on its image and negatively impact the Company's business and operations.\nAdditionally, the Company might depend on certain equipment suppliers and service providers due to supply limitations, especially as a result of the operational characteristics of the Brazilian electricity sector, and the technical specifications of the equipment used in its facilities, which causes the Company to have only a few suppliers available, and even only one supplier for types of equipment. Any problems with those suppliers in the medium and long terms can negatively impact the Company's business and operations.",
  "The Company's maintenance requirements and demands for construction of new wind/photovoltaic plants or transmission lines are met by a limited number of suppliers. Accordingly, the Company is vulnerable to market supply and demand, especially in times when there are large investments in the energy sector, which can cause the  Company  to  pay  high  prices  for  the  services  and  materials  used  in  such  construction.  The  inability  or unwillingness of these third parties to provide the services contracted by the Company with the quality stipulated in their agreements or to supply the materials necessary for performing their services can: (i) cause a default of the Company's regulatory obligations; (ii) put at risk the preservation of its generating plants and electricity transmission systems; and/or (iii) temporarily reduce the availability/electricity generation capacity of its plants and electricity transmission systems. Consequently, the Company may obtain lower sales revenues and have possible exposure to the short-term market, which can have an adverse effect on the Company's results and image. Furthermore, the termination of such agreements for the supply of materials and for construction or operation and maintenance services or any inability to renew them or negotiate new agreements with other equally qualified service providers, in a timely manner and at similar prices, can have an adverse impact on the Company's results.\nAdditionally, supply chain risks,  including  strikes or work  stoppages,  loss of or  damages  to equipment or its components while in transit or storage, natural disasters or the outbreak of any contagious illness or disease, such as COVID-19, could limit the implementation of the Company's projects.",

Any such changes could hamper the direct use of electricity by consumers, as well as the demand for products in the domestic and foreign markets, affecting the economic activity of the Company's free market customers and consequently reducing the need for electricity, thereby adversely affecting the Company's financial results.\nAny noncompliance, by the relevant counterparties, with any provisions of their sale and purchase agreements signed with the Company and transactions in the CCEE can have an adverse effect on the Company's business and results.\nIn the ordinary course of its business, Company enters into electricity purchase and sale agreements with its customers. The Company cannot ensure that its customers will honor their payment commitments under such agreements. In the event of noncompliance with the terms of such an agreement by any customer, especially major ones, the Company may have its cash flow and operations compromised and, consequently, sustain a material  negative  impact  on  its  financial  condition  and  results.  In  addition,  any  default  by  the  Company's customers may result in contingencies and possible losses arising primarily from the difference between the\nprices agreed upon by the Company and the prices charged in the short-term market when the agreement is breached in order to meet obligations to deliver electricity to its customers.\nAdditionally,  when  it  comes  to  transactions  in  the  CCEE,  any  lack  of  registration  of  electricity  purchase agreements with such Chamber due to absence of financial guarantees provided by suppliers will lead to a debt position in the CCEE (energy balance) at a price different from that agreed upon. If the agreement price is lower than the difference settlement price (PLD), there can be a significant financial impact. Furthermore, there may be  a  penalty  for  insufficient  backing  and  degradation  of  the  TUSD/TUST  discount  (for  incentivized  energy agreements), resulting in a financial impact on the Company.\nFurthermore, (i) the downward pressure on costs by customers concerning the collaterals posted in electricity sale agreements, (ii) any conflicting interpretations of agreements or related regulations, and (iii) any difference between prices under bilateral agreements and spot prices, or the prices of local distributors, are events that can negatively affect business in the electricity sector and have an adverse effect on the Company's business and results.",
  "The electrical sector is vulnerable to natural factors, such as floods and rain shortages, that affect electricity generation capacity and to the restrictions of Brazil's interconnected electricity transmission system, which prevent a greater harnessing of the Brazilian electricity generation potential.\nThe low average rainfall in the years immediately prior to 2001, combined with the lack of expansion of installed capacity  of  the  National  Interconnected  System  (SIN)  due  to  legal  and  regulatory  obstacles  found  in  the thermoelectric capacity expansion program, which is not consistent with the increases in demand that have taken place, resulted in a sharp fall in reservoir levels in the Southeast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the country and, consequently, in a nationwide electricity rationing.\nFaced with that adverse condition, on May 15, 2001, the Federal Government implemented an electricity use cut-back program that became known as the Rationing Program. The Rationing Program imposed electricity use reduction rates on industrial, commercial and residential consumers that ranged from 15% to 25%, and lasted from June 2001 to February 2002.\nIn the hydrological year of 2021, Brazil set the worst record in all the measurement history, since 1931: average Affluent Natural Energy (ENA) of 51.6 GWm-on average, 1.6 GWm below the ENA for 1971, the worst year on the record until then. Water scarcity was particularly concentrated in the first nine months of the year.\nAnticipating  that  risk,  in  October  2020  the  Brazilian  Electric  System  Operator  (ONS)  began  a  series  of negotiations  with  the  agencies  involved,  requesting  additional  thermal  power  output,  over  and  above  that requested by order of merit, as well as flexibility on the minimum inflow rates of various SIN hydroelectric plants, on behalf of the preservation of reservoirs.\nTherefore, electricity rationing and shortage scenarios began to be considered at the beginning of the second half of 2021, following the media repercussion of warnings regarding the lowest historical levels recorded for the reservoirs, particularly in the months of August and September. The situation reversed in the last quarter of the year, which saw the fourth best hydrology of the last decade due to the advance in time of the wet period.\nIf Brazil goes through more periods of electricity shortages, the Federal Government may implement policies and measures that could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company, as well as on the market value of securities issued thereby. A relevant part of the contracts signed by the Company are with the Government, involving a strict public bidding process or call for bidders. Competing for those contracts often involves long and complex selection and bidding procedures, which are affected by numerous factors. such as market conditions, government approvals and environmental  issues.  The  Company  cannot  predict  or  control  the  timing  or  occurrence  of  new  bidding opportunities or call for bidders. Delays or cancellations of these processes due to economic conditions, prices and availability of materials and equipment, exploratory campaigns with results weaker than expected or other factors can adversely affect the Company's growth.\nFurthermore,  the  Company  cannot  guarantee  that  public  bidding  processes  or  calls  for  bidders  will  not  be affected by investigations. Investigations during a bidding process or call for bidders may cause delays and impact principals' investment plans.\nIf the principals do not hold any new bidding processes or calls for bidders or if such processes are delayed, including due to investigations, or if they do occur, but the Company does not qualify to participate or to obtain new concessions, the growth of the Company's business may be adversely affected.",
  "In the electricity purchase and sale agreements signed by the Company and its subsidiaries, the latter agreed to generate and deliver specified amounts of electricity. Any difference between the energy generated and the energy delivered can be related to: (i) an incidence of resources at an intensity different from that considered in studies conducted when the energy is sold; and (ii) unavailability of equipment at a level higher than the agreed performance rates. If these situations occur, the Company and its subsidiaries may experience a decrease in their respective estimated revenues, which may adversely affect cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries may be required to purchase energy by signing short-term electricity purchase agreements,  which  are  possibly  more  costly,  or  on  the  spot  market  to  meet  its  obligations,  which  may compromise its financial profitability and the quality of its services to consumers.\nSpecifically with regard to hydroelectric generation assets, in the event of unfavorable hydrological conditions, when the total energy generated in the Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE) is lower than the sum of the physical  guarantees  of  all  plants  participating  in  the  mechanism,  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  may  be required to purchase energy in the spot market in sufficient quantity to meet the unmet demand, particularly if such volume is greater than the hedge amount used by the Company. Prices on the spot market may be more expensive than the prices charged under the electricity sale agreements signed by the Company's subsidiaries with their customers, given the natural volatility of the spot market. In that case, the financial results and business of the Company and its subsidiaries can be materially adversely affected.\nFinally, there can be no assurance that, in the event of default in the spot market (or if the CCEE qualifies certain situations, such as legal disputes, as default by its agents), the Company and its subsidiaries will receive the payments due as a result  of  electricity  sale  transactions  carried  out  on  said  market,  which  could  materially adversely affect the Company's financial results and business.\nAny unavailability of the transmission system and/or disturbances in the quality of services can adversely affect the Company and its subsidiaries operating in the transmission sector.\nThe operation of electricity transmission grids and systems involves several risks, such as operational difficulties and unforeseen interruptions. These events include accidents, breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, performance below expected levels of availability and efficiency of transmission assets, and catastrophes, such as  explosions,  fires,  natural  phenomena,  landslides,  sabotage  or  other  similar  events.  In  addition,  actions  by governmental authorities responsible for the electric power grid, the environment, operations and other affairs can also affect transmission lines.\nThe net operating revenues that the Company's subsidiaries earn as a result of the implementation, operation and maintenance of their electricity transmission facilities are related to the availability and continuity of services. According to their respective concession agreements and the applicable regulations, the Company's subsidiaries are  subject  to  a  reduction  of  their  respective  Permitted  Annual  Revenues  (RAPs)  due  to  the  application  of Variable Payments by the ONS and the Aneel's imposition of any penalties, depending on the level and duration of  any  such  service  unavailability.  Therefore,  interruptions  in  its  lines  and  substations  may  have  a  material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.",
  "The Company is subject to comprehensive legislation and regulations imposed by the federal government, the Aneel and the MME, and it cannot predict the effect of any changes to the laws or regulations currently in force on its business and results of operations.\nThe Company's main activities are regulated and supervised by the Federal Government, through the MME, the Aneel, and non-profit civil associations, such as the CCEE and the ONS, while being subject to legislative changes introduced by the National Congress. The MME and the Aneel have discretionary powers to implement and change  policies,  interpretations  and  statutes  applicable  to  various  aspects  of  the  Company's  activities, particularly operational, maintenance and safety aspects, as well as aspects related to the compensation for and supervision of those activities, and any such change may impact the Company's results. Accordingly, such main activities of the Company, including, but not limited, trading activities, the implementation of its growth strategy and the end result of its concessions, can be adversely affected by government actions, among them we name the following: (i) change to laws applicable to the Company's business; (ii) discontinuance and/or changes in the criteria  for  granting  authorizations  to  exploit  potential  wind  and  solar  farms;  (iii)  discontinuance  of  and/or changes in the criteria for granting authorizations to trade electricity and keep such authorizations valid; (iv) discontinuance of and/or changes in the criteria for granting authorizations and keeping environmental licenses valid by the federal, state or municipal governments, as applicable; (v) discontinuance of and/or changes in the criteria for land regularization and for granting permits, licenses, registrations and real estate authorizations by the  federal,  state  or  municipal  governments  and  their  agencies,  as  applicable;  (vi)  discontinuance  of  and/or change in benefits for the exploitation of renewable energy parks; (viii) changes in the types and the terms and conditions of electricity sale agreements that the Company is authorized to enter into; and (ix) changes in the electricity production levels of the Company's plants.\nThe Federal Government has implemented significant changes in legislation applicable to the Brazilian electricity sector during recent years, particularly through the Concessions Law, Law No. 9,648 of May 27, 1998 (or the Electric Sector Law), Law No. 10,848 of March 16, 2004 (or the Electric Sector Restructuring Law), and Law No. 12,783 of January 11, 2013, in as well as administrative regulations. These measures aimed to detach regulatory authority from the Federal Government, increase private investment in electricity generation, transmission and distribution in Brazil, encourage competition in the sector and contribute to affordable rates. As part of this restructuring process, the regulatory power was assigned to the Aneel.\nThere is no way to predict future reforms and changes to regulations in the electricity sector and their effects on the Company and its subsidiaries, which may not be able to pass on to customers the possible costs of laws and regulations that may be enacted, so their results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company is also subject to a review of the physical guarantee of its assets and delays in the implementation of annual price adjustments to its electricity agreements, which can negatively affect its results.\nThe concession contracts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which authorize it to generate electrical energy from the hydroelectric plants of its hydroelectric plants or to transport electrical energy from transmission lines, and the authorizations are subject to termination in some cases.\nUnder the Concession Agreements signed by the Company and its subsidiaries and with the Granting Authority, through the Aneel, several concessions were granted to the Company and its subsidiaries for hydroelectric plants from which the Company produces most of the electricity traded thereby. The current concessions held by the Company and its subsidiaries will expire between 2030 and 2048, as set out in section 1.6 of this Reference Form.\nThere  is  no  assurance  that  the  concessions  currently  granted  to  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  will  be extended by the Granting Authority beyond the expiration dates already approved. Furthermore, the extension of a concession will probably be granted for payment, by the Company and its subsidiaries, of a fee known as a Grant Bonus (BO).",
  "Additionally, such Concession Agreements provide that each concession may be terminated before its expiration (i)  in  the  event  of  expropriation  by  the  Granting  Authority  for  reasons  of  public  interest,  (ii)  in  the  case  of expiration of the concession (under the Concession Agreements) or (iii) in the event of noncompliance by the Company and its subsidiaries with their obligations set out in the Concession Agreements and the applicable laws and regulations, in which case the concession will be declared terminated. The Company and its subsidiaries may also request the termination of concessions in the event of noncompliance the obligations of the Granting Authority, but that requires specific legal action.\nThe  indemnity  to  which  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  entitled  in  the  event  of  termination  of  the concession may not be sufficient to recover the full value of certain assets. In addition, if any of the Concession Agreements is terminated due to noncompliance with the Company's obligations, then the effective amount of indemnity payable by the Granting Authority may be significantly reduced by the imposition of fines or other penalties.\nAccordingly, any early termination of any Concession Agreements, either jointly or individually, for any reason, would have a material adverse effect on the conduct of business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company, as well as on the market price of securities issued by the Company.\nThe Aneel may impose penalties on the Company for noncompliance with any provision of the Generation and Transmission Concession Agreements and authorizations of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe Aneel may impose penalties on the Company and its subsidiaries if they fail to comply with any provision of their generation and transmission concession agreements or authorizations. Such penalties may include:\n· warnings;\n· fine  for  noncompliance,  limited  to  a  maximum  of  2% of  the  annual  revenue  from  the  concession  or authorization or, if the concession or authorization in question is not operational, to a maximum of 2% of the estimated value of the electricity that would be generated in the twelve-month period preceding the occurrence of such default;\n· stop work orders on the construction of new facilities or equipment;\n· restrictions on the operation of existing facilities and equipment;\n· affirmative obligations;\n· negative obligations;\n· temporary suspension of participation in bidding processes for new concessions;\n· revocation of authorization;\n· the Aneel's intervention in the management of the offending concessionaire; and\n· forfeiture of the concession or permission.\nThe Aneel also may, without prejudice to the aforementioned penalties, temporarily intervene in the concessions granted to the Company and its subsidiaries to ensure the appropriate exploitation of the generation park and transmission assets and compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.\nFurthermore, under Technical Note No. 53/2022-SFE/Aneel, the penalties applicable to unjustified delays to start the commercial operation of transmission concessions must be contractual and public notice fines-the fine under the aforementioned Aneel Normative Resolution No. 846/2019 are not applicable, and it will be used from the start of commercial operation or only on a supplemental basis during the implementation period. In this regard, the penalty due may be a fine of up to 10% of the investment in the project (corresponding to the budget of  the  concession  agreement,  as  updated  by  the  annual  adjustment  index  set  forth  in  the  agreements),  to calculated based on the development of the project and length of delay.\nIn addition, any delays to implement and start the operation of transmission grids may result in the application of the Variable Payment for Delay in the Commercial Start-up ('PVA') in the RAP, which corresponds to the deduction of a portion of the base payment for a facility due to the delay in its commercial start-up.\nAny of the foregoing penalties, as well as Aneel's intervention in generation and transmission concessions or authorizations granted to the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company, as well as on the market value of securities issued by the Company. New rules for electricity sales and market conditions may affect, in the future, the selling prices charged by the Company for electricity.",
  "Any uncontracted electricity may be allocated to the ACL or the ACR.\nThe applicable laws allow distributors that contract with the Company and its subsidiaries in the existing ACR electricity auctions to reduce their contracted quantities, up to a limit of 4%, at no cost, exposing the Company and its subsidiaries to the risk of not contract the respective reduced volume on the same terms with another customer or at appropriate prices.\nFurthermore, there can be a decrease in the electricity contracted with the Company and its subsidiaries due to the departure of potential free market consumers from the distributors. If the Company is unable to contract excess  capacity  at  adequate  prices,  that  can  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  conduct  of  its  business,  and  its revenues and results of operations can be negatively affected in the future, and so can the market value of securities issued by the Company. The Industry Charges for Use of the Transmission System ('TUST') and Use of the Distribution System ('TUSD') are  payable  by  electricity  generation  companies  to  transmission  and  distribution  companies,  respectively, according to the use of transmission and distribution systems needed for the electricity output to meet demand. Under  Law  9,427/1996,  regulated  by  Aneel  Normative  Resolution  no.  1,031/2022,  incentivized  energy generation projects will be entitled to TUSD or TUST charge reduction rates of 50%, 80% or 100%, applicable to both the production and use of electricity sold, as applicable, for the projects that meet the requirements set forth in said Resolution for each charge reduction rate. In this context, for the conduct of business in some of the Company's operating segments, there is an obligation to enter into Transmission System Use Agreements ('CUST') and Distribution System Use Agreements('CUSD') and to pay the TUSD and TUST charge.\nHowever, it is worth pointing out Law 14,120/2021, which stipulated the expiration date of the wire discount for centralized renewable energy plants, which had until March 2022 to request their concessions in order to be still entitled to the benefit. The Company's wind, solar and biomass plants in operation or in the implementation stage still enjoy the benefit for the entire period of their concessions.\nAny  change  in  regulations  that  benefits  renewable  energy  consumers  may  impact  prices  for  energy  from renewable sources and, consequently, the Company's results and cash generation. The Company operates exclusively in the Brazilian market.",
  "The Company and/or its subsidiaries may be affected by new demarcations of indigenous lands by Brazilian authorities, by settlements, by occupations by social movements and traditional communities, as well as by complaints from communities neighboring its projects/enterprises.\nTraditional communities (indigenous peoples and remnants of runaway African slave communities, the latter being known as 'quilombos,' and its members as 'Quilombolas') and/or social movements, such as the Landless Rural Workers Movement, are stakeholders in several projects in Brazil and usually request federal and state governments to carry out land demarcation procedures, land tax collection and land designation, agrarian reform and the compulsory redistribution of land, which may cover areas currently occupied by the Company and its subsidiaries, forcing them to cease operating in said areas or renegotiate existing land occupation agreements, which may adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial results and negatively affect its image and reputation.\nIn addition, organized social movements opposed to the expansion of the Brazilian generation park through large hydroelectric projects may interrupt or cause significant delays in the course of implementation and/or operation of hydroelectric projects, through demands for collective and/or individual resettlements, benefits, compensations or indemnities, among other things, not to mention those planned and expected by companies in the  electricity  sector,  including  the  Company.  Any  action  to  that  effect  by  such  social  movements  could negatively affect business in the electricity sector and have an adverse effect on the Company's business and results.\nFurthermore,  the  communities  neighboring  Company's  projects  or  enterprises  (among  others,  indigenous peoples and traditional communities, such as riverside communities and Quilombolas) may be affected by their activities, which will sometimes require prior, free and informed consent procedures, as well as interaction with control  agencies,  such  as  the  National  Foundation  of  Indigenous  Peoples,  and  the  National  Institute  for Settlement and Agrarian Reform, among others. In this regard, the Company and/or its subsidiaries may be subject  to  legal  or  administrative  proceedings  due  to  failure  to  comply  with  any  laws  and/or  regulations applicable to those communities, which may generate criminal and administrative sanctions (including fines and partial or total suspension of activities), without prejudice to the obligation to redress any damages caused at the civil level, so the Company's financial results, results of operations and the Company's image may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to obligations concerning the respect for the human rights of all stakeholders, as applicable, which may cause the Company to incur additional costs, as well as significant contingencies related to social issues.\nExposure to social risks varies according to the specific characteristics of each company, its industry and its geographic location, so each company must consider such particular details to determine the social risks that are deemed material, according to its strategy and business model. In general, social risks arise from the potential and  actual  adverse  impacts  of  its  business  activities  on  the  human  rights  of  all  stakeholders,  as  applicable, including its own employees, suppliers and the local community where the Company operates.\nThe respect for traditional  communities-indigenous peoples, riverside and Quilombola communities, among others-that inhabit any regions close to its assets in operation and/or under implementation must follow the guidelines of Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO).\nThe Company must also ensure decent working conditions for its employees, caring for their health, safety and well-being and respecting their right of association and participation in trade unions, in accordance with the local laws and regulations and respecting human rights. A workplace identified as dangerous, hostile or discriminatory may result in legal contingencies and inhibit the Company's ability to attract and retain talent, negotiate with associations and unions, prevent occupational health and safety incidents, and drive innovation.\nBy the same token, if the Company fails take well-structured initiatives integrated into long-term planning to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, both in its staff and in the composition of its governance bodies and leadership team, it may be questioned about the absence clear goals and effective actions in that area.",
  "If the Company is unable to ensure compliance with obligations concerning the respect for the human rights of its stakeholders, as applicable, it may incur additional costs, as well as significant contingencies related to social issues and reputational damages.\nAny failure to meet the expectations of the Company's primary stakeholders concerning environmental, social and  corporate  governance  matters  may  damage  the  Company's  reputation,  increase  its  costs,  reduce  its revenues or expose the Company to additional risks.\nThere is an increasing focus on ESG issues among customers, investors and other stakeholders, as public interest and legislative pressure regarding the ESG practices of businesses continue to grow. Increasing investor focus and activism related to ESG issues and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate  capital  or  stop  investing  as  a  result  of  their  assessment  of  a  particular  company's  ESG  practices. Furthermore, the Company has set targets focused on ESG issues, through its ESG 2030 Agenda, which, if not achieved, could adversely impact its reputation and, consequently, its results of operations.\nCertain institutional investors use consultancy services that provide recommendations on votes at meetings and guidelines on proxy voting and analyzes of ESG attributes. If the Company does not align the proposals of its\nAnnual General Meeting with such recommendations or guidelines, some shareholders may vote against these proposals, which may negatively affect it. Companies that do not adapt or meet the ever-changing expectations or standards of investors, consumers or other stakeholders or are not responding adequately to the growing concern about ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, can have their reputation damaged, and their business, financial condition and/or share prices could be significantly harmed.\nIf  the  Company's  ESG  practices  and  policies  do  not  meet  constantly  evolving  expectations,  standards  and frameworks, its reputation, financial condition and employee retention could be damaged.",
  "The occurrence of environmental damages involving the Company's activities may subject it to the payment of environmental recovery costs and indemnities.\nActivities in the energy and gas sector can cause negative impacts and damages to the environment.\nFor example, hydroelectric plants have the potential to harm native fish, just as wind farms and transmission lines have the potential to harm birds. Furthermore, companies in the electricity sector, particularly those engaged in generation and transmission, are subject to strict environmental legislation at the federal, state and municipal levels regarding, among other matters, specially protected areas (permanent preservation areas and conservation units),  archaeological  heritage  areas,  caves,  etc.  Impacts  on  the  fauna  and  protected  spaces  are  usually contemplated in environmental licensing processes, but adverse situations may occur that cause unforeseen damages.\nSoil and/or water contamination also carries environmental liability, as there is no statute of limitations on the obligation to repair environmental damages, meaning that liability for environmental damages does not end after a specified period or by succession. Contaminated areas are those that contain quantities or concentrations of any substances or waste in conditions that cause or may cause damage to human health, the environment or other assets to be protected.\nFederal legislation imposes on those who cause environmental degradation the duty to repair or redress any damages  caused  to  the  environment  and  third  parties,  regardless  of  the  existence  of  negligence.  Federal legislation also provides for the piercing of the corporate veil of polluting companies, as well as the personal liability of their management, to enable the redress for damages caused to the quality of the environment.\nAccordingly,  the  shareholders  and  management  of  a  polluting  company  can  be  forced  to  pay  the  costs  of environmental repairs. The payment of substantial environmental recovery costs and environmental indemnities may force the Company to delay or redirect investments in other areas, which would have an adverse effect on its business and the market value of securities issued thereby, as well as its image. Furthermore, the Company may suffer criminal and administrative sanctions (including fines and partial or total suspension of activities), so the Company's financial results and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges to environmental laws and regulations can adversely affect the business of companies in the electricity sector, including the Company.\nCompanies in the electricity sector, particularly those engaged in generation, are subject to strict environmental legislation at the federal, state and municipal levels regarding, among other issues, atmospheric emissions and interventions in specially protected areas. Such companies are required to have licenses and authorizations from government agencies to conduct their business. Furthermore, their activities are considered to have a significant environmental impact, which generates the obligation to pay environmental compensation under Federal Law No.  9,985/2000.  In  the  event  of  breach  of  or  noncompliance  with  such  laws,  regulations,  licenses  and authorizations, companies may suffer administrative sanctions, such as fines, closures, cancellation of licenses and revocation of authorizations, or be subject to criminal sanctions (including their management).\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office may commence a civil investigation and/or immediately file a civil class action seeking redress for any damages to the environment and third parties. Government agencies or other authorities may also issue new, more stringent rules or seek more restrictive interpretations of existing laws and regulations, which may require companies in the electricity sector, including the Company, to spend additional resources on environmental compliance, including obtaining environmental licenses for facilities and equipment that did not previously require such licenses.\nGovernment agencies or other authorities may also significantly delay the issuance of licenses and authorizations necessary for the conduct of the business of companies in the electricity sector, including the Company, causing delays in project implementation schedules and consequently having adverse effects on the Company's business and results.\nYou should also consider the possible creation and implementation of new regulations or government policies that aim to mitigate climate change, which discussions occur at the global and national levels and may affect the Company.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries may fail to meet the conditions set out in the environmental licenses of their projects, may not be able to meet any new conditions or may not be able to secure or correct the licensing of any projects that may be acquired.",
  "Under  the  applicable  regulations,  the  activities  carried  out  by  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  require environmental licensing granted by the relevant. Such licensing is usually subject to conditions that may involve limitations on implementation or operation.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries may fail to meet any of the aforementioned conditions, in which case it will be subject  to  environmental  repairs,  fines,  criminal  liability  or  even  the  revocation  and/or  suspension  of  their respective licenses, which may impact the regular conduct of their business, including the risk of total shutdown, consequently having a material adverse effect on the Company's results.\nThe  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  may  also  be  subject  to  changes  in  the  conditions  of  their  licenses  when renewing them, and meeting such conditions may require investments or even downtimes that would no longer be technically viable, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results.\nAdditionally, the Company and its subsidiaries may not be able to secure or correct the environmental licensing of any projects that they may acquire and/or are under development, thereby being subject to fines or even the revocation and/or suspension of these respective licenses, which can make a material adverse impact on the results  and  operations  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries,  while  causing  a  delay  in  the  operation  of  the aforementioned projects under development or implementation.",
  "Climate change poses a significant risk to the Company's activities, in terms of both physical and transition risks.\nPhysical risks include the extreme climate-related events listed above, such as droughts, floods and storms, which can affect the electricity generation and transmission and gas transportation infrastructure, causing significant disruptions or damages. Additionally, the Company's generation assets depend on hydrological, solar and wind sources, which are natural resources and depend on weather events, which can ether increase or decrease the availability of these resources and consequently the amount of electricity generated from those assets.\nTransition risks include the possibility of changes in government regulations, changes in consumer preferences for renewable energy sources, and fluctuations in energy commodity prices. For example, in Brazil, discussions are advancing on the bill designed to regulate the Brazilian Emissions Trading System (SBCE) (Bill No. 182/2024),\nwhich  could  usher  into  various  industries  new  obligations  and  rules,  including  the  energy  sector.  The materialization of transition risks can negatively impact the Company's results.\nAs a consequence of global warming, more accidents and natural disasters have been happening, such as storms, cyclones, hurricanes, floods, droughts, etc. Therefore, the Company has been considering and assessing, among other risks, such factors as floods, heat waves, water stress and extreme windstorms. These events can cause damages  to  generation  resources  and  sources,  as  well  as  the  physical  structures  of  assets  in  the  Brazilian electricity sector, with possible consequences to the environment and communities.\nThe  potential  value  of  the  financial  impact  can  range  from  R$236  thousand  (SHP)  to  R$2.4  billion  (large hydroelectric  plant),  including  costs  related  to  advisory  services,  specialized  technical  service  and  facilities maintenance. The calculation was done in 2023, involving scenarios for ENGIE Brasil Energia's 13 hydroelectric plants, with damages to third parties not involved in the valuation.\nFurthermore, the Company has committed to climate target and, if it does not achieve the targets set for any reason, then it can sustain reputational damage, as well as possible questions from interested parties.",
  "The  Company's  results  of  operations  can  be  impacted  by  any  changes  to  the  Brazilian  tax  laws  or  any unfavorable results of tax contingencies and/or any suspension or cancellation of tax benefits or otherwise by any need for provisioning contingencies not materialized due to unfavorable judgments by the Higher Courts.\nThe Brazilian tax legislation regularly undergoes changes introduced the various relevant agencies, and those can include the creation of new taxes, changes in tax rates and adjustments to taxes bases, which, at times, may or may not be temporary and/or related to specific government purposes. In addition, changes in the interpretation of existing statutes applied by Brazilian courts are frequent. Some of these changes can result in an increase in the Company's tax burden, adversely affecting its profitability and product prices.\nIn addition to the inherent risk of changes to existing legislation, different bills are currently making their way through  the  National  Congress  that  seek  to  regulate  consumer  tax  reforms  (various  purchase  and  sale transactions), one having been approved by Amendment No. 132 to the Federal Constitution on December 21, 2023. This reform contemplates the termination of four taxes: PIS, COFINS, ICMS (state), and ISS (municipal). These taxes will be replaced by three new taxes: the Tax on Goods and Services (IBS), under the purview of state and municipal governments, the Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS), under the purview of the federal government, and the Selective Tax (IS) (which does not apply to transactions involving electricity), also under federal jurisdiction. Note that, at the current stage, the aforementioned bills can still be noticeably changed, so there is no way to accurately measure the impacts on the Company. Some of these measures could increase the Company's total tax liabilities, which, in turn, could adversely affect its results.\nInternational events and developments, such as wars and conflicts, can adversely affect the global economy, supply chains and capital markets.\nThe Company's business and the securities market are influenced, in different ways, by political, economic and market developments in other countries, so any events and developments that may generate or contribute to political and economic instability in financial and securities markets, including wars and international conflicts, can  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  global  economy,  adversely  affecting  the  capital  market  and  the Brazilian economy, with fluctuations in exchange and inflation rates, impact on the supply of credit, and investor perception and interest in the Brazilian securities market and the Company itself. The materialization of those effects  can,  therefore,  adversely  affect  the  Company,  the  conduct  of  its  business  and  its  ability  to  fund  its operations.\nThe Federal Government has exerted and continues exerting significant influence on the Brazilian economy. That influence, as well as the economic circumstances and Brazilian politics, can have a material adverse effect on the Company's activities and results of operations, as well as the price of the Company's shares.\nThe Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent and eventually drastic interventions by the Brazilian government and by unstable economic cycles, which may continue to happen in the future. Changes to laws and regulations made in recent years, serving political, social, and economic interests, have often involved, among other  measures,  increases  or  decreases  in  interest  rates,  changes  in  fiscal  and  tax  policies,  wage  and  price controls,  exchange  rate  controls,  frozen  bank  accounts,  currency  devaluation,  capital  controls  and  import restrictions. The Company does not control and cannot predict the measures or policies that the governments of the countries where it operates may adopt in the future.",
  "The Company's business, financial performance and results of operations can be adversely affected by changes in policies and regulations either involving or affecting certain factors, such as: (i) inflation; (ii) exchange rate fluctuations;  (iii)  exchange  and  interest  rate  control  policies;  (iv)  interest  rate  fluctuations;  (v)  availability  of liquidity in the domestic capital, credit and financial markets; (vi) strikes by employees of port, customs and tax authorities; (vii) changes in transportation market regulations; (viii) import and export controls; (ix) price increases for oil and other inputs; (x) price instability; (xi) labor and social security regulations; (xii) water and energy scarcity and rationing; (xiii) fiscal and/or health policies; and (xiv) any other economic, political, diplomatic and social events in or affecting Brazil.\nUncertainty about the implementation of changes by the Federal Government to any policies or statutes that may affect those and other factors in the future can contribute to economic uncertainty in Brazil, which may hamper operational activities and results, and could even adversely affect the trading price of the Company's shares.\nAny  actions  by  the  Federal  Government  concerning  any  policies  or  regulations  that  may  involve  the macroeconomic factors listed above can adversely affect business and the analysis of sensitivity to interest rate hikes.  Furthermore,  changes  in  share  prices  of  publicly-held  companies,  credit  shortage,  spending  cuts,  a slowdown in the global economy, exchange rate instability, interest rate hikes in Brazil or abroad and inflationary pressure can adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the Brazilian economy and capital market, which could reduce global liquidity and investor interest in the Brazilian capital market, negatively affecting the price of shares issued by  the  Company  and  thus  having  negative  consequences  to  its  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of operations. We cannot to predict the impact that such political events and macroeconomic developments, either global or in Brazil, could have on the Company's business.\nChanges in interest rates can increase the Company's debt costs and consequently have an adverse effect on its results of operations.\nThe Central Bank of Brazil sets the key interest rate for the Brazilian banking system based on several factors, including economic growth and inflation levels, and uses changes in such rate as an monetary policy tool. The Company is exposed to the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations, in particular the DI Rate, to which a substantial portion of the Company's debt is linked.\nThe Company may incur losses due to any fluctuations in interest rates that may increase its financial expenses related to its debt or obtain lower returns on its investments. A substantial portion of the Company's debt is linked to floating interest rates (DI Rate, IPCA, and TJLP).\nAny significant increases in consumption, inflation or other macroeconomic pressures could result in those rates being raised. For more information about the Company's exposure to the interest rate risk, see section 4.3 of this Reference Form.\nInflation and certain measures taken by the Federal Government to combat it may contribute to economic uncertainty in Brazil, adversely affecting the Company's results of operations.\nHistorically,  Brazil  has  recorded  high  inflation  rates  compared  to  more  developed  economies.  Inflation  and certain measures taken by the Federal Government to combat it, such as raising the economy's key interest rate ('SELIC'), have had a material negative impact on the Brazilian economy, as they reduced the level of economic activity and increased the cost of funding business, while reducing long-term investments. The annual inflation rates for 2021, 2022 and 2023 were 17.79%, 5.45% and 3.18%, respectively, according to the General Market Price Index (IGP-M), and 10.06%, 5.78% and 4.62%, respectively, according to the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA). The Monetary Polic Committee (Copom) frequently adjusts said interest rate in situations of economic  uncertainty  to  achieve  the  targets  set  in  the  Brazilian  government's  economic  policy.  Inflation, government measures to combat it and public speculation about possible future governmental measures have had  material  adverse  effects  on  the  Brazilian  economy  and  contributed  to  economic  uncertainty  in  Brazil, increasing the volatility of the Brazilian capital market, which can have an adverse effect on the Company.",
  "Any measures taken by the Brazilian government in the future, including lowering interest rates, intervening in the foreign exchange market and implementing mechanisms to adjust or determine the value of the Real, could trigger inflation, adversely affecting the overall performance of the Brazilian economy.\nIf  Brazil  should  experience  significant  inflation  in  the  future,  there  can  be  no  prediction  as  to  whether  the Company will be able to offset the effects of inflation on its cost structure by passing on the cost increases resulting  from  inflation  to  the  prices  charged  to  its  customers,  which  could  narrow  down  the  Company's operating margins.\nFurthermore, in the event of an increase in inflation, the Brazilian government may choose to significantly raise interest rates. For additional information on the risks related to increases in interest rates, see ' Changes in interest rates may increase the Company's debt costs and, consequently, have an adverse effect on its results of operations .' Risk related to potential damages to biodiversity resulting from land use or disruption of ecological continuity. New projects, as well as the current operation of the Company's assets, can be subject to increased costs, fines being imposed or its operating license being lost or its projects rendered either unfeasible for being in conflict with  current  or  future  regulations  on  biodiversity  or  no  longer  able  meet  the  expectations  of  the  various stakeholders in relation to the issue. Risk related to the emergence of new, disruptive technologies in the energy and gas sectors, which technologies, being aligned with the energy transition to the gas sector and seeking to respond to the dependence on natural factors in the electricity sector (hydrology, prevailing winds, sunlight, etc.), are not yet fully known. The adoption of  those  new,  disruptive  technologies  could  lead  to  obsolescence  of  the  Company's  assets  and  result  in regulatory  changes  in  the  sector,  bringing  about  cost  increases  or  even  making  the  Company's  operation unfeasible.",

Climate change poses a significant risk to the Company's activities in terms of both physical and transition risks.\n3. The  construction,  expansion  and  operation  of  electricity  generation  plants  and  transmission  lines  involve significant risks that can lead to loss of revenues or increased expenses.\n4. The Company is subject to comprehensive legislation and regulations imposed by the federal government, the Aneel and the MME, and it cannot predict the effect of any changes to the laws or regulations currently in force on its business and results of operations.\n5. The Company depends on digital systems, and any failure of or attack on these systems can adversely affect the Company's activities. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was exposed to the following market risks:\n(a) Risks related to debts and concessions subject to floating interest rates and indices.\n(b) Risks related to liabilities denominated in foreign currency.\n(c) Risks related to energy prices in trading operations. This risk is related to the possibility that the Company may sustain losses due to fluctuations in the interest rates and  financial  indices  applied  to  its  liabilities,  having  effects  on  its  financial  expenses.  The  Company  and  its subsidiaries are exposed to floating interest rates and indices, consisting of changes in the TJLP, DI rate, IGP-M and IPCA rates.\nRegarding the floating interest rate risk, part of the contracted debt is linked to the long-term interest rate (TJLP), which tends to fluctuate keeping pace with fluctuations in interest rates and inflationary effects.",

The understanding of the tax authorities is that the amounts transferred by Eletrobrás relating to  the  acquisition  of  mineral  coal  and  other  fuels  are  revenue  and,  therefore,  should  be  the  basis  for  calculating the aforementioned taxes.. , Case No. 10340.720480/2023-26 = The Company filed, on July 4, 2023, through its external legal counsel, an objection to the AI.. , Case No. 10340.720480/2023-26 = On April 1, 2024, the Company were notified of an unfavorable decision, and a voluntary appeal was filed  against the decision on April 29, 2024.. , Case No. 10340.720480/2023-26 = A decision on the voluntary appeal is awaited..

(j) Reason why the case  is considered significant, Case No. 10340.720480/2023-26 = Considering the amounts involved from the notice of tax violation, which exceed R$ 150 million reais, as  well as the possibility of the case unfolding that could be replicated in subsequent years, as well as the fact  that such discussion directly impacts the operation structure of the Plant, we understand that this matter  should be considered significant.. (k) Review of the impact  in case of loss, Case No. 10340.720480/2023-26 = In case of loss, we will incur expenses of R$282 million and our assets will be reduced by the same amount  upon disbursement. Additionally, in the event of any failure to resolve this dispute, the Company intend  to seek reimbursement of these tax charges through the review of the Unit Variable Cost (CVU) of the  plant and reimbursements through the Energy Development Account.",

The reserved amount is R$9.9 million (amount updated on December 31, 2023).\nThe  Federal  Prosecutors'  Office  of  Goiás  (MPF-GO)  filed  a  Public  Civil  Action  claiming  the  alleged occurrence of the following problems related to the implementation and environmental licensing of the Cana Brava HPP (built in 1998 and in operation since 2002): (i) preparation of detailed studies to quantify submerged  vegetation  in  the  reservoir  area  of  the  Cana  Brava  HPP;  (ii)  removal  of  all  biomass  that, according to technical criteria, is not considered necessary to protect the fish fauna, to improve water quality and the multiple uses of the reservoir (including navigation); (iii) preparation of a detailed report on the rescue of fauna, to be submitted for analysis by Ibama; (iv) implementation of measures aimed at ensuring control of the expansion of epidemiological diseases throughout the region directly or indirectly affected by the enterprise; (v) implementation of a social and environmental mitigation and compensation program for impacts caused to the land and the Avá Canoeiro indigenous community; (vi) transfer of the environmental licensing process to Ibama; (vii) compensation for environmental damage resulting from the failure  to  remove  vegetation;  (viii)  compensation  for  damage  caused  to  the  social  and  environmental heritage of the Avá-Canoeiro indigenous community; and (ix) compensation to the indigenous community for collective pain and suffering, in an amount to be arbitrated in court.",
  "The Company challenged the Public Civil Action, making all claims, documents and requests filed by the MPF  controversial,  based,  in  summary,  on  the  following  arguments:  (i)  existence  of lis  pendens and connection with Public Civil Actions No. 2004.35.00.004291-3 and No. 2006.35.00.016335-1, in the 2 nd Federal Court of Goiás - it should be noted that such actions have already been terminated; (ii) defendant ENGIE's lack of standing to be sued; (iii) lack of interest in taking action related to the request to prepare a wildlife rescue report, as it has already been prepared; (iv) lack of interest in taking action in relation to the implementation of public health measures and programs, once they have been implemented; (v) lack of interest in taking action in relation to the request to adopt mitigating and compensatory measures for the indigenous community, since there is a proposal from the entrepreneur awaiting a response from the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI); (vi) legal impossibility of requesting compensation for collective moral damages; (vii) Law No. 3,824/60, which requires the suppression of existing vegetation in areas to be flooded  by  reservoirs,  must  be  interpreted  considering  technical  evolution,  in  the  sense  that  what  is technically recommended is suppressed in order to guarantee maintenance environmental quality; (viii) the suppression  of  vegetation  in  the  area  flooded  by  the  reservoir  was  carried  out  properly,  based  on authorization granted by the environmental agency, which has a presumption of legality; (ix) the lack of suppression of all vegetation did not cause environmental damage - there is no navigation on the river, the hydroelectric plants emit few greenhouse gases and the quality of the water in the reservoir is good; (x) fauna rescue was adequately carried out; (xi) there was no expansion of epidemiological diseases in the region - official data demonstrate that the information in the complaint is not accurate; (xii) regarding the Avá-Canoeiro indigenous area, the entrepreneur proposed to take the necessary measures to promote fair mitigation and compensation for the affected area.\nA meeting was held with the MPF and FUNAI to discuss the necessary actions. Emergency measures were agreed and taken and it was agreed to prepare a study based on a Term of Reference prepared by FUNAI. The Study was carried out, but after its completion, FUNAI requested a new, different study. As the new study aims not only to compensate for the impacts, but to study the entire indigenous reserve, which in the Company's understanding is FUNAI's obligation and falls outside the scope of the action, the Company did not agree with its drafting.\nIn 2008, acknowledging the connection formulated in our defense, the Federal Judge of the 3rd Court ordered the redistribution of the case to the 2 nd Federal Court.\nIn 2009, we requested the attachment of the document 'Epidemiological Survey of the Morbidity and Mortality Index in the UHCB Region', showing that the reservoir did not cause an increase in any form of disease in the region.\nIn an injunction, the Federal Judge of the 2 nd Court ordered: the transfer of the licensing process to Ibama; that the Company submits technical studies on submerged vegetation; the implementation of an action plan to control the spread of diseases in the region; and that we submit a compensation proposal for the indigenous community and a report on the affected road network.\n(g) Summary of decisions rendered on the merits\n(h) Case stage\n(i) Chance of loss\n(j) Reason why the case is considered significant\n(k) Review of the impact in case of loss\nThe Company filed an appeal against the preliminary decision and the Federal Regional Court of the First Region (TRF1) revoked the order to suppress flooded biomass, and considered the adoption of measures to control the expansion of epidemiological diseases unnecessary. Appeals were filed against this decision; however, there were no immediate effects contrary to the TRF1 decision, which remains.\nIn  February  2011,  the  case  was  suspended  for  six  months  upon  request  of  the  plaintiff,  the  Federal Prosecutors' Office.",
  "In  June  2014,  the  case  was  suspended  again  for  sixty  (60)  days  upon  the  request  of  the  Federal Prosecutors' Office.\nIn October 2016, IBAMA filed a statement in favor of the Company.\nThe Company have been seeking negotiations with FUNAI, with the aim of reaching a settlement and putting an end to the case.\nIn 2023, FUNAI and the Company continued to negotiate to approve the work plan under discussion, and reached a consensus on measures to be adopted. Currently, this work plan is in progress. In parallel, the case is at trial stage, in the initial stage of the fact-finding phase.\nCase still pending judgment at trial court.\nTrial fact-finding phase.\nProbable in relation to the mitigation and compensation program for the impacts caused to the land and the Avá-Canoeiro indigenous community due to the installation and operation of the Cana Brava HPP, as well as compensation and full reparation for the damage caused to the social and environmental heritage of the aforementioned indigenous community. Possible for other requests.\nCase that individually may have a negative impact on our image.\nIn case of loss, the Company will have a reduction in available assets (current assets) and liabilities of R$ 10 million (updated on December 31, 2023) for the request considered probable and, therefore, reserved, with no impact on results and net worth.\nIn this aspect, the Company, even before the lawsuit was filed, were already seeking a settlement with FUNAI.  However,  we  never  received  a  response  from  that  body.  The  transfer  of  AGMA's  Operating License to Ibama has no consequences for the Company. In relation to other requests, the possibility of loss, although remote, brings financial impacts that cannot be valued at this time.\nAdditionally, the case may have a negative impact on our image.\n(a) Court\n(b) Instance\n(c) Date of establishment\n(d) Parties to the case\n(e) Values, assets or rights involved",

  "11 th Federal Court of the District of Curitiba (State of Paraná).\nTrial.\nSeptember 2, 2020 and October 16, 2020.\nPlaintiffs: OJC (Observatory of Justice and Conservation); SPVS (Wildlife Research and Environmental Education Institute); RMA (Network of Non-Governmental Organizations of the Atlantic Forest); State and Federal Prosecutors' Offices.\nDefendants: IAT - Paraná Water and Land Institute; IBAMA; and Gralha Azul Transmissão de Energia S.A. (subsidiary of ENGIE Brasil Energia S.A).\nTo be set.\nThese are two Public Civil Actions filed by the Plaintiffs mentioned above, whose purpose is the legality of the environmental licensing of the Gralha Azul Transmission System.\nThe  Gralha  Azul  Transmission  System  will  cover  27  municipalities  and  is  made  up  of  approximately 1,000km of lines and 10 substations, subdivided between 10 transmission lines (525/230 kV); 5 sections of existing lines at 230 kV; 5 new substations; and 5 substations to be expanded, grouped into seven different licensing groups, according to their technical, geographic and environmental characteristics as determined by the competent environmental body. The environmental licensing process began in 2018, and was conducted in a transparent manner by the competent environmental body - Institute of Water and Land (IAT) of Paraná. Throughout the licensing process, several aerial and ground inspections, public hearings and technical meetings were carried out, and approval was issued by several intervening bodies, such as Funai, Fundação Cultural Palmares, IPHAN, CINDACTA - COMAER and Municipal Governments. The environmental licenses were duly issued by the IAT, and the works began.\nHowever, in September and October 2020, the Plaintiffs demonstrated their dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the environmental licensing - in particular, the alleged illegal splitting of the licensing, the alleged lack  of  IBAMA's  consent,  the  suppression  of  vegetation,  the  project  layout  and  others  environmental aspects presented in the complaints, such as impacts on speleological heritage, indigenous and quilombola communities.\nGralha Azul, IAT and IBAMA presented statements in favor of the project defending its legality. However, within the scope of ACP 5042816-11.2020.404.7000, whose purpose is limited to two licensing groups (525kv  lines),  an  injunction  from  the  plaintiffs  was  granted  to  partially  suspend  the  works  on  the Transmission System. The Federal Government and the State of Paraná entered the case, in defense of the project and as simple assistants to Gralha Azul.\nThe Federal Government, State of Paraná and Gralha Azul filed a request to suspend the injunction to the Superior Court of Appeals (STJ), which was granted by the chairman of the Court. The plaintiffs filed an internal appeal. This appeal is currently underway at the STJ Special Court.\nIn ACP 5050258-28.2020.4.04.7000, whose purpose encompasses the entire Gralha Azul Transmission System, an injunction was also granted, determining the suspension of works in a specific section called 'Devonian Escarpment'. The Federal Government, the State of Paraná and Gralha Azul filed with the STJ a motion to extend the effects of the STJ's first decision, which had suspended the previous injunction. Such request was granted, fully suspending the second preliminary decision. This new STJ decision was also appealed via Internal Appeal at the STJ Special Court.\nA decision is currently awaited from the Special Court of the STJ regarding the two preliminary decisions.\nPending  the  STJ's  judgment,  the  parties  unanimously  agreed  to  suspend  both  ACPs  for  settlement negotiations. The parties have met several times extrajudicially and an agreement is being negotiated. ACPs are suspended. After prolonged discussions, the parties did not reach an agreement and the case must begin at trial court.\nCase still pending judgment at trial court.\nFact-finding phase has not yet started\nPossible.",
  "Case that individually may have a negative impact on the image of the Company and whose adverse judgment, if it occurs, will still depend on the respective investigation in the settlement of the judgement.\nGralha Azul Transmissão de Energia may be ordered to redo the environmental studies, re-conduct the licensing process, suspend the works or operation of the project, remove the buildings or change their layout, and recover or compensate any environmental damages found. Additionally, the Company may have our image and financial condition negatively impacted. Of the cases listed in item 4.4, the amount of R$ 10 million was acknowledged as probable risk and reserved. International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (CIA-CCI)\n(a), 1 = Review of the impact in  case of loss. (a), 2 = ENGIE seeks acknowledgement of the exclusivity of a right that involves the receipt of certain amounts.  In case of loss, this right will not be acknowledged and we will no longer receive such amounts.. (b), 1 = Amounts involved. (b), 2 = R$130 million (amount updated on December 31, 2023). As of December 31, 2023, there were no other relevant contingencies not covered by the previous items. The business risk and opportunity management policy ('Risk Management Policy') defines the general concepts and lays out the governance to be applied in relation to risk taking and management, in order for the Company to achieve medium and long-term goals, while providing guidelines for specific risk management policies and setting quantifiable limits and risk thresholds, risk-taking criteria and technical options for risk handling. The current Policy was approved by the Executive Board on September 29, 2016 and by the Board of Directors on February 23, 2017.",
  "The Risk Management Policy aims to:\n· ensure the application of ENGIE's values, as well as related governance principles, to enterprise risk management procedures;\n· define the roles and responsibilities of the Business Risk Management functional line (Enterprise Risks Management, or ERM);\n· lay out the enterprise risk management process;\n· lay out its division into specific risk management policies; and\n· stipulate the contribution by enterprise risk management to the Company's governance.\n(i) Risks for which protection is sought\nThrough the Risk Management Policy, the Company aims to identify and mitigate risks that can adversely impact it, which includes, but is not limited to, the following risk categories:\n(a) Strategic\n(b) Financial\n(c) Operational Among  the  risk  mitigation  plans  underway  at  the  Company  are  insurance  contracts,  derivative  financial instruments (hedge)  contractual guarantees, staff training, ISO 9001, 14001 certifications, etc. ,\nEnterprise  risk  mitigation  plans  can  be  either  permanent  or  temporary  and  aim  to  bring  risk  down  to  levels acceptable to the Company. Specifically with regard to market risks, as set out in section 4.3 of this Reference Form, they are monitored by the Financial Forum, which periodically evaluates the Company's exposure and proposes operational strategies, control system and position and credit limits toward others market partners. Regarding the risk of acceleration of inflation, all energy sale agreements in force have an inflation adjustment clause, stipulating the application of either the IGP-M or the IPCA, which represents a natural long-term hedge for debts and obligations pegged to inflation indices and/or fluctuation in inflation. With regard to the risk of floating interest rates, part of the debt contracted is linked to the Long-Term Interest Rate (TJLP) and the CDI rate, which tends to fluctuate keeping pace with fluctuations in interest rates and inflationary effects. Therefore, contracted debts linked to TJLP and CDI tend to be hedged by the aforementioned energy sale agreements and by the Company's cash flow. We should note that, in agreements signed by December 31, 2018, the amount corresponding to the portion by which the TJLP may exceed 6% p.a. is incorporated into the principal of the debt, which mitigates the immediate impact on the Company's cash flow in the event of acceleration of the TJLP. As of January 1, 2019, the Company had not entered into any contract pegged to the TJLP.",
  "The Company's exchange rate risk hedging policy seeks to achieve a low level of exposure to exchange rates in its  liabilities  and  commitments  denominated  in  foreign  currency,  which  are  permanently  monitored  by  its Financial Forum.\nThe derivative financial instruments held by the Company correspond to transactions designed to hedge its exposures to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations, which are recognized according to the standards stipulated for hedge accounting as mentioned below. ,\nAt the start of a hedge transaction, formal documentation is prepared describing the goals and strategies for managing the  covered  risk  and  the  relationship  between  the  transaction  subject  to  hedge  and  the  hedging instrument  used  for  the  expected  protection.  The  Company's  hedge transactions  that  qualify  for  hedge accounting are as follows: The hedge transactions  for  protection  from  exchange  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company's  loans  result  from liabilities linked to the CDI rate, that is, non-fixed components, and are therefore designated as 'fair value hedge.' The Company designated its hedges for exposure to financial commitments to acquire assets denominated in foreign currency as cash flow hedges . Market risk management concerning trading operations is under the purview of the Risk Committee, which annually approves the risk limits that can be assumed in transactions by the trading desk. All trading operations are governed by the Company's credit policy.",
  "The governance structure model for corporate risks at the Company is based on the three lines of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), which directs the responsibilities of the Company's business, risk management, Internal Audit and senior management teams (Executive Board and Board of Directors).\nThe organization of risk management is based on the various participants at each level at the Company: The role of the Board of Directors and the Statutory Audit Committee, in the context of risk management, is to monitor the effectiveness of the risk management system. The Executive Board plays a supervisor and decision maker's role in the context of risk management. Accordingly, at least once a year, it examines and approves the review of enterprise risks. The  Company's  Risk  Officer  contributes  to  improving  the  knowledge  of  strategic  risks,  thus  increasing  its credibility, improving the risk taking assessment, and both maintaining and creating value. Their role consists of:\n· assisting the Executive Board in managing risks;\n· certifying that the Company's enterprise risk management policy is being implemented; and\n· participating in the preparation of the review of the Company's risks, risk intelligence and policy structure and methodology for the enterprise risk management process. At  EBE,  the  consolidation  and  management  of  enterprise  risks  and  opportunities  are  conducted  by  the Governance, Risks and Controls (GRC) team.",
  "In addition, to more efficiently conduct the risk assessment process of its business, the Company has a Risk Management Forum, which is charged with contributing to the identification and analysis of the Company's enterprise risks and opportunities.\nThe Forum's activities are company-wide and therefore performed by representatives of the Company various departments, and the general coordination of the Risk Management Forum is under the purview of the Financial and Investor Relations Officer.\nIn the enterprise risk analysis process, each identified risk is classified according to its probability of occurrence, significance (or severity) and degree of control. From this analysis, a mitigating action plan is developed for each of  the  risks.  The  manager  of  the  department  from  which  the  risk  originates  is  the  'risk  owner'  and  will  be responsible for implementing the action plan. As risks are analyzed, there is also an assessment made of any opportunities that could be implemented by the Company.\nAs a result of the analysis process, an enterprise risk and opportunity matrix is obtained, which is submitted to the Executive Board for approval and introduced to the Statutory Audit Committee, the Board of Directors and, subsequently, to the Controlling Shareholder. The Company believes that its strategic risk management structure is appropriate to ensure the effectiveness of the adopted policy. Managers are responsible for identifying, elaborating on and continuously monitoring the risks associated with their teams or business processes.\nAt the Enterprise Risk Manager (ERM) level, the GRC acts as a 2 nd  Line, providing support to managers, which includes developing and implementing policies, methodologies, processes and the strategic risk communication structure. These initiatives are carried out in an integrated and standardized manner, ensuring a cohesive risk management across the organization. The ERM is submitted to the Executive Board for approval, is analyzed by the Statutory Audit Committee and submitted to the Board of Directors on an annual basis.\nIn addition, the strategic risk management system is assessed during the analysis the overall control environment at the entity level.\nAdditionally, the Company has an Internal Audit department, which reports directly to the Board of Directors. This  department  aims  to  independently  assess  the  effectiveness  of  risk  management,  internal  control  and corporate governance  processes. Through  analyses, recommendations  and  information, Internal Audit contributes  significantly  to  the  Company's  management,  focusing  on  enterprise  risks  and  fostering  the continuous improvement of internal processes.",
  "The Company's Management is responsible for setting up and maintaining a system of internal controls suitable to its operating and corporate environments. This system contributes to lowering risks to acceptable levels and supporting Management in making strategic and governance decisions.\nThe Company's Internal Controls Program, known as the INCOME Program, was developed by the Internal Controls department of the parent company ENGIE S.A. (headquartered in France) and is implemented in all entities of the ENGIE Group. The Program uses a self-assessment methodology for internal controls (control selfassessment), in which qualified professionals, known as BPOs (Business Process Owners), periodically evaluate the relevant controls under their purview.\nThe implementation of internal controls and self-assessment is charged to the business teams (1 st  line), following the Company's guidelines and the control model laid out by the ENGIE Group. To ensure the reliability of the self-assessment, a sample of controls is tested by independent auditors other than those responsible for auditing the  Company's  financial  statements.  Any  deviation  identified  in  the  efficiency  or  effectiveness  of  internal controls is addressed by action plans, which prepared by the teams in charged and regularly monitored. The results  of  both  the  self-assessment  and  control  tests  are  reported  to  Management,  as  part  of  the  job  of monitoring the Company's internal controls environment.\nThe  Company's  internal  control  system  provides  reasonable  comfort  about  the  reliability  of  the  financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil, which include the regulations of the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM), the pronouncements issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), and the guidelines of the Electricity Sector Accounting Manual (MCSE).\nDue to their inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may fail to prevent or detect errors. Furthermore, any forecast concerning the future effectiveness of internal controls is subject to the risk that they may become obsolete due to changes in operating conditions or any decrease in the level of adherence to established practices and procedures.",
  "The Company has an internal controls team (2 nd  line) who report to the Governance, Risks and Controls (GRC) management and is in charge for coordinating the INCOME Program, reporting the main facts to the Executive Board, the Statutory Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer and the Financial and Investor Relations Officer annually assess and certify the effectiveness of the INCOME Program, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX).\nThe  following  table  demonstrates  the  organizational  structures  involved  in  the  preparation,  reporting  and supervision of the Company's internal controls:\nControl Owner, Activity involved in maintaining the internal controls environment = Executing and/or managing internal controls to mitigate risks in business processes.

  "The Company has a Governance, Risks and Controls department, responsible for advising organizational units on the  implementation,  changes  and  self-assessment  of  the  Company's  internal  controls.  GRC  reports  to  the Executive Officers, the Board of Directors, the Statutory Audit Committee and the Controlling Shareholders the results of their control tests, which are assessed by external auditors hired specifically for the INCOME Program, as well as the results of the control self-assessments conducted by the BPOs. The INCOME Program's control testing cycle is designed so that all of the Company's internal controls are tested within no more than 5 years.\nSupervision of the effectiveness of internal control mechanisms and responses to identified risks is provided by the Statutory Audit Committee, which reports directly to the Board of Directors.\nThe  annual  results  of  the  INCOME  Program  are  submitted  to  the  Executive  Officers,  the  Statutory  Audit Committee and the Board of Directors,  who  analyze  and  approve  the  activities  carried  out  and  the  results achieved. The independent auditors, while performing their duties, developed an understanding of the internal controls considered relevant to the external audit process for the purpose of identifying and assessing risks of material misstatements in the Company's individual and consolidated financial statements and, as regulated by item II of article 25 of CVM Resolution No. 23, dated February 25, 2021, issued a detailed report indicating their opinion on what constitutes significant flaws in controls.\nThe auditors from Ernst & Young Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. reported a significant flaw in the process related  to  the  review  of  contingency  provision  estimates,  especially  for  timely  updating  information  in  the internal process monitoring system and processes conducted by external legal counsel.\nThe independent auditors recommended that the Company's management: (i) improve the design and attributes of its internal controls over the processes that are monitored in the Company's internal system; (ii) evaluate the sensitivity of the loss prognosis determined by the external advisor; and (iii) design internal review controls over the calculation of adjustment for inflation done by the Company's internal system.\nFurthermore, the independent auditors identified a distinction between the prognosis classification practices used in one of the Company's consortia and the methodologies used internally. The auditors recommended a standardization of internal processes between the Company and its consortia. In compliance with CPC 25 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, the Company recognizes the solidity of its current methodology. However, discussions held with the independent auditors contributed to the  understanding  of  the  controls  that  require  improvements  and  redesign.  The  Company  is  committed  to reviewing  and  reassessing  the  current  process  and  strengthening  existing  controls.  The  Legal  department  is charged with implementing the improvements, taking a progressive approach to ensure that the recommended measures are incorporated effectively and in the most timely manner possible.\nWe should note that the risks and flaws identified in internal controls by the independent auditors did not affect the auditors' opinion on the Company's individual and consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and for previous years.",

The  Company's  Code  of  Ethics  can  be  found  on  the  Company's  website (https://www.engie.com.br/investidores/),  as  well  as  on  the  websites  of  B3  (www.b3.com.br)  and  the  CVM (www.cvm.gov.br).\n(ii) The  organizational  structures  involved  in  monitoring  the  workings  and  efficiency  of  internal  compliance mechanisms  and  procedures,  indicating  their  responsibilities,  whether  their  creation  was  formally  approved,  the issuer's bodies to which they report, and the mechanisms to ensure the independence of their leaders, if any\nAiming to ensure the application of the Code of Ethics and other ethics and compliance reference documents at the Company and its subsidiaries, the Ethics Committee was created, which reports directly to the Board of Directors, to be the coordinating and stewardship group for compliance with ethical principles, which committee was given the necessary authority to perform this role, and also had appropriate human and financial resources made available thereto.\nThe Company's Ethics Committee, created on July 2, 2002 by a Resolution of the Executive Board, is composed of: (i) the Legal and Ethics Officer; (ii) the People, Processes and Sustainability Officer; (iii) the People and Culture Manager; (d) the Internal Audit Manager; and (e) the Governance, Risks and Controls Manager; with the Legal and Ethics Officer responsible for coordination. The responsibilities assigned to the Ethics Committee, included in the Company's Organization Manual, are the dissemination, application and monitoring of ethics benchmarks, aiming to prevent ethical risk and promote professional practices, in accordance with the commitments of ENGIE Brasil Energia.\n(iii) If the issuer has a formally approved code of ethics or conduct, indicating:",

The complaint handling procedure ensures that reported facts are investigated in an impartial manner, responsibilities are identified and, if necessary, appropriate sanctions are imposed and corrective actions are taken, regardless of hierarchical level. The result of any such investigation is formally reported to the interested parties and recorded in the Company's corporate tools.\nAs  set  out  in  the  Company's  Code  of  Ethics  and  in  the  Personnel  Management  Manual,  for  proven  ethical breaches,  the  application  of  disciplinary  actions  to  employees  may  result  in  a  verbal  or  written  warnings, disciplinary suspension and even termination of employment or contract. For companies hired by the Company and its subsidiaries, any failure to comply with ethical principles may result in contractual sanctions or immediate suspension of the contract in question and, if appropriate, legal proceedings.\n· Body that approved the code, date of approval and, if the issuer publishes the code of conduct, websites on which the document can be viewed\nThe Company's Code of Ethics is the main reference document of the Ethics and Compliance Program. The Company's Code of Ethics can be found on the Company's website (https://www.engie.com.br/investidores/), as well as on the websites of B3 (www.b3.com.br) and the CVM (www.cvm.gov.br).\nThe current version of the Code of Ethics was approved by the Company's Board of Directors at a meeting held on June 4, 2024.",
  "· Whether the whistleblower channel is internal or managed by third parties\nThe Company has an external whistleblower channel for complaints related to ethical issues, which channel managed by an external company and available 24 (twenty-four) hours a day, 7 (seven) days a week. Access to the channel is via the website https://www.canalintegro.com.br/engiebrasil or by calling 0800 580 2586 (calls free of charge).\nThe external channel enables any employee, supplier, customer and/or partner to describe, on condition of anonymity  for  whistleblowers  who  choose  that,  the  occurrence  of  any  noncompliance  or  fraud  or  the\nexistence of inappropriate and unethical conduct that could affect the image and financial results and the work environment of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nAll reported situations are kept in absolute secrecy, with assurance of non-retaliation. The investigation is carried  out  confidentially,  and  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  Ethics  Committee  is  the  body  responsible  for investigating complaints.\n· Whether the channel is open to receiving reports from third parties or whether it only receives reports from employees\nThe whistleblower channel is available to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as third parties.\n· Whether there are mechanisms for anonymity and protection for good-faith whistleblowers\nAs previously highlighted, the Company's Ethics Committee ensures anonymity to whistleblowers who so choose.\nAnyone reporting, responsibly and in good faith, any concerns related to ethics or noncompliance situations cannot be subject to any reprisal or penalty for reporting such situations.\nWe should also emphasize that the anonymity of the whistleblower, as well as anyone else involved, will be preserved by the Company, and the investigation will be carried out confidentially.\n· Issuer's body responsible for investigating complaints\nThe body responsible for investigating complaints is the Company's Ethics Committee.\nc.

If  the  issuer  does  not  have  rules,  policies,  procedures  or  practices  aimed  at  preventing,  detecting  and remedying fraud and offenses committed against the government, identify the reasons why the issuer has not put any such controls in place\nNot applicable to the Company.",
  "There was no material change in the main risks to which the Company is exposed or in its Risk Management Policy for the last fiscal year. However, the Company monitors risks in the global economy as set out below.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company was following the war in Ukraine and had not detected any impacts resulting from the war in Ukraine on its individual and consolidated financial statements. However, the Company assesses that the impact on the economy could be large, depending on the size and extent of the war, which could dim down prospects for economic growth. Additionally, assuming that there is no worsening of the war, the  Company does not estimate any significant effects  on  its  results  that  could  compromise  its  operational capacity or the implementation of its projects.\nRegarding the conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Company does not have any contracts with any party involved in the conflict. Although there are no direct impacts of the conflict on the Company, there are impacts on the world economy that will be most felt in the countries that become involved. The magnitude will be very different if the conflict is restricted to Gaza and Israel than if it involves, for example, Syria, Lebanon and finally, Iran, given the historical conflicts between these countries. If that occurs, the impacts will be global, rather than just regional. The Company will continue monitoring developments. Additionally, assuming that the situation does not get worse, the Company does not estimate any significant effects on its results that could compromise its operational capacity or the implementation of its projects.",
  "To set criteria for the investment of financial resources available in the financial market and limits to the use of derivatives. Ensuring liquidity for the operation of the Company and its subsidiaries and security for their operations is the basic guideline of the Investment and Derivatives Policy. The financial investments available to the Company and its subsidiaries must observe the following allocation rates, considering the consolidated amounts invested by each company:\n· at least 90% of the funds in Federal Government Securities;\n· no more than 10% of the funds in Private Securities. The limits set out above do not take into account any debentures issued by the Company's subsidiaries, and the executive board has powers to subscribe for, pay in, buy, sell and trade debentures from its subsidiaries, limited in amount, individually or jointly, to 10% (ten percent) of the Company's authorized capital. Aiming to support and complement the analysis and judgment of Banking Risk, the Company uses the risk ratings published by the agencies Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's or Fitch, consultancy firms specializing in this area. Based on ratings from the agencies S&P, Moody's or Fitch Banks, banks must be selected according to the following criteria:\n· banks with a minimum net equity of R$1 billion; and\n· AA- (S&P and Fitch) or Aa3 (Moody's) rating on a national scale. The  maximum  limit  for  operating  with  any  given  Bank  (considering  its  respective  financial  group,  where applicable) is 5% of the consolidated cash on hand of the Company and its subsidiaries, with restricted financial investments excluded from that limit, such as CDBs linked to Reserve Accounts.",
  "· Repo  transactions  backed  by  the  Company's  debentures  and  lease  purchases  from the  same  financial conglomerate as the Bank must be considered as the Bank's own CDB, for credit limit purposes.\n· The limits stipulated in item 'e' do not apply to investments in National Treasury Securities, the risk of which is borne by the Federal Government, and not the Bank. With the exception of the debentures mentioned in item 'c', transactions with private credit risk, regardless of their term, are mainly aimed at daily liquidity. Whenever applicable, financial transactions must be confirmed through their registration with the Securities Custody and Financial Settlement Center (CETIP) or in the Special Settlement and Custody System (SELIC), with the corresponding deposit of the securities backing the transactions. · The use of derivatives is restricted to risk protection (hedging), and leverage transactions and short sales are prohibited.\n· The underlying assets and their derivatives must have the same risk factor.\n· Interest and/or currency derivative transactions, when used to hedge corporate financing, must maintain a close correlation in terms of debt profile, volumes and terms.\n· The counterparty in derivative transactions must have one of the following minimum ratings:\n- AA- (S&P or Fitch) or Aa3 (Moody's) on a national scale; or\n- A+ (S&P or Fitch) or A1 (Moody's) on an international scale.\n· The Executive Board shall approve any and all contracts for transactions using derivatives, with the Board of Directors being responsible for approving contracts for those in which the contract volume or net position at risk exceeds R$50 million.",

  "The corporate risk governance structure model in place at the Company, including climate risks, is based on the three-line model propose by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), which directs the responsibilities of: (i) the business teams; (ii) the risk management team; (iii) Internal Audit; and (iv) the Company's senior management (Executive Board and Board of Directors).\nIn addition, to more efficiently conduct the process of assessing the risks of its business, the Company has its Risk Management Forum, which is tasked with contributing to the identification and analysis of the Company's enterprise risks and opportunities. The general coordination of the Risk Management Forum is provided by the Financial and Investor Relations Officer.\nIn the enterprise risk analysis process, each identified risk is rated according to its probability of occurring, significance (or severity) and degree of control. From that analysis, a mitigating action plan is developed for each of the risks. Managers in whose scope of responsibilities any risks originate are the 'risk owners' and will be responsible for implementing the action plan. As the risk analysis is conducted, any potential opportunities that could be seized are assessed as well.\nAs a result of the analysis process, an enterprise risk and opportunity matrix is obtained, which is then submitted to the Executive Board for approval and presented to the Statutory Audit Committee, the Board of Directors, and subsequently to the Controlling Shareholder.\nIt  is  noteworthy that since 2022, risks and opportunities related to climate change have been considered a priority by the Controlling Shareholder and been an integral part of the Company's risk matrix.\nPlaying  a  fundamental  part  in  achieving  the  commitments  assumed  by  the  Group,  in  2023,  the  Company strengthened its Climate Journey-a climate governance program designed to consolidate the climate strategy, risk management, metrics and goals, driving in a structured way actions and targets for the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. By addressing the mitigation and adaptation plans that are being implemented by the Company and that will continue in the coming years, the Climate Journey represents the new cycle of a successful  series  of  operations  decarbonization  efforts  that  culminated  in  electricity  generation  exclusively from renewable sources-a milestone reached in 2023, with the sale of the last coal-fired thermoelectric plant that was part of the Company's generation complex.\nRanking  among  the  top  10  groups  of  risks  to  be  managed  by  the  Company,  climate  risk  requires  a comprehensive, cross-sectional assessment methodology. Accordingly, the management process is aligned with the  Group's  guidelines  and  involves  not  only  the  senior  management,  but  also  the  Audit  Committee,  the Corporate  Risk  Management  Forum,  the  Governance,  Risks  and  Internal  Controls  Management,  the Environment and Climate Management and Investor Relations Management, among other teams.\nThe assessment and management of climate risks follows the recommendations of Task-Force Climate Financial Disclosure (TCFD), and the management process for those risks contemplates an assessment of physical and transition  risks  of  assets  owned  by  the  Company,  as  well  as  any  impacts  on  the  business  or  its  vicinities, assessing the vulnerability, exposure and resilience of assets in face of major extreme weather events. Based on the identified risks, climate change adaptation plans were put together, providing a set of strategies and actions carried out to manage the impacts and risks associated with climate change, considering projections and multiple possible future scenarios. Accordingly, they support the preparation of the Company to effectively respond  to  changes  in  environmental  conditions  caused  by  climate  change.  In  2023,  the  Company  began preparing adaptation plans for each asset, considering risks, causes, consequences and financial impacts of the effects of climate change, among other issues. Throughout 2024, new risks and opportunities will be assessed, including the monetary impact of those considered critical to the Company. Based on that analysis and the proposed plans per asset, the senior management will be able to direct the necessary funds to mitigating and adapting to climate change.",

('ENGIE Brasil Participações'). As described in items 8.1 and 8.5, 8.6, 8.7 and 8.8, for medium and long-term objectives, the direct controlling company, ENGIE Brasil Participações, offers the Executive Board and certain members of the Board of Directors a share-based ILP Phantom Shares of the Company. The ILP Plan is approved by ENGIE Group CEO Catherine MacGregor and the latest plan was approved in mid2022. There is no maximum number of shares covered. The maximum number of Phantom Shares to be distributed corresponds to the sum of the maximum individual value as described in item 'd' below divided by the value of the shares. As described in item 'e' below, the value of the ILP (% of the annual salary converted into Phantom Shares) is limited to 130% of the Company's salary range for the executive's position plus the ILP defined for that position on the grant date. The annual base salary added to the adjusted ILP cannot exceed this limit. The  ILP  is  intended  for  executives  of  the  Company  and  the  direct  controlling  shareholder,  ENGIE  Brasil Participações,  who  hold  a  Management  contract  and  a  position  on  the  companies'  Executive  Board.  The controlling shareholder annually determines which executives will be eligible for ILP. The market value of Phantom Shares is calculated using the simple average of the closing price of the EGIE3 share in the three months prior to the grant date. At the end of the three years of the plan, the market value of these phantom shares (again calculated using the average closing of EGIE3 in the three months prior to the end date) will be the basis of the amount of the premium to be paid for achieving the goals. The end date will be the 15th day of May following the 3rd year of the plan, after the results of the previous year are closed. The ILP establishes that the duration of the plan will be three years, according to the last review carried out in mid-2022 - see item 8.4 (b).",
  "The plan involves a specific deferred bonus, paid in cash, after a three-year vesting period. The payment of ILP to the Statutory Officers is made by us and to the Chairman of the Board of Directors by the direct controlling company, ENGIE Brasil Participações and reimbursed by the Company. Given that the ILP provides for the payment of a specific deferred bonus based on phantom shares , it  is  not possible to transfer the shares. The direct controlling shareholder, ENGIE Brasil Participações, has the prerogative, at any time with or without prior notice, to modify, change, adjust, insert or eliminate the conditions of the ILP, as well as opt for the decision to cancel future grants, regardless of justification. Executives who leave the Company before the end of the three-year grace period provided for in the ILP will automatically  waive  the  right  to  any  payment  within  the  plan.  Exceptions  will  apply  if:  termination  of  the relationship with the Company to carry out activities in other companies of the ENGIE Group, for retirement purposes due to length of service or disability, to join voluntary termination programs, due to termination without cause by the Company's decision or as a result of the death of the executive.",

  "There were no grants of shares from the Board of Directors and the Statutory Board carried out over the past three fiscal years, and there is no forecast for the current fiscal year. Justification for not completing the table:\nAs of the date of submission of this document, there are no outstanding shares to be delivered directly to the beneficiaries of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. The Long-Term Incentive Plan ('ILP') is proposed annually by the direct controlling shareholder, ENGIE Brasil Participações Ltda., considering the following parameters:\n· The individual amount will be established as a percentage of the executive's annual base salary.\n· The nominal average performance amount in the past three years on the date of grant of the ENGIE S.A. performance share plan (Performance Shares) granted in the previous year will be deducted from the 'ILP' amount.\n· The resulting amount will be converted into a number of Phantom Shares in accordance with the market price of our share (EGIE3), determining the basis for the amount of the premium to be paid for achieving the objectives on the termination date of the plan. To calculate the grant of phantom shares, the market price of the share will be considered, calculated using the simple average of the EGIE3 closing price in the three months prior to the grant date. The grant date is the same as that set out in the Performance Shares plan of the indirect controlling shareholder, ENGIE S.A., generally in December of each year.",
  "While the plan is in force, the number of shares allocated to determine the amount of the incentive may be increased proportionally based on the price of the share when we pay our shareholders dividends and interest on equity. Such adjustment will be made by calculating the dividend yield of the closing price of the EGIE3 share on the date.\nThe exact amount of the incentive will be calculated using the following formula: (% SB - - average in the past three years VF PSP) / EGIE3 share price on the plan start date = X number of phantom shares (Start). For the final amount of the shares, consider: X Number of phantom shares x EGIE3 share price on the final date. And the total payment will be the final price of the shares multiplied by the performance indicators. Where:\n· % SB means a % of the annual base salary varying by the executive's salary scale on the plan's start date;\n· VF PSP means the face value of ENGIE S.A.'s Performance Shares granted over the past three years, with EUR/BRL quotation and exchange rate on the date of grant of these shares.\n· EGIE3 share price as detailed in item 'a' of this section There is no provision for early vesting in the share-based ILP model applied by the Group. Not applicable to the share-based ILP plan model applied by the Group, since the volatility of shares was not considered in the calculation to set the bonus amount. The total ILP payment will be a percentage of the price of the shares at the end of the cycle. Such percentage will be determined by the results achieved in the four performance indicators of the plan, over the three-year period of the plan: ROCE (return on capital employed) of the ENGIE group - 30%, total shareholder return - 25 %, RNRPG (net recurring revenue) - 25% and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) - 20%.\nAt the end of the three years of the plan, the market price of these shares (again calculated using the average closing of EGIE3 in the three months prior to the end date) will be the basis of the amount of the award to be paid for achieving the goals. The end date will be the 15th of March following the third year of the plan, after the results of the previous year are closed.",

  "The Company has a Committee called 'Special Independent Committee for Transactions with Related Parties' ('Special Independent Committee for Transactions with Related Partis' or 'Independent Committee'), created by the Board of Directors at the 106th Meeting, held on September 30, 2010. Under the terms of the 'Regulation of the Special Independent Committee for Transactions with Related Parties' ('Regulation of the Special Independent Committee for Transactions with Related Parties'), the body is composed of three (3) to five (5) members elected and dismissible by the Board of Directors from among our officers, with the majority of independent members of the Board of Directors, the  other  members  being  our  Officers.  The  independence  of  members  is  characterized  as  defined  by  the  Novo Mercado (B3).\nThe main responsibilities of the Committee are:\n· negotiate the terms and conditions in transactions with related parties, with freedom and independence, defining the structure and other conditions of the business to be submitted to the Board of Directors and/or the General Meeting;\n· select  and  decide,  whenever  deemed  necessary  and  appropriate,  to  engage  specialized  consultancy  in  the technical, legal, financial, and accounting areas to assist you in their work, submitting the formalization procedures for hiring to the Company's management, and the Board of Directors will at the implementation of the Independent Committee approve a global budget for its operation; and\n· select  and  decide, whenever  the  transaction with  a  related  party  involves  the  acquisition  of  interest  in  other companies,  assets  or  rights  and/or  the  exchange  of  interest  by  hiring  a  first-class  financial  institution  for independent assessment of the property, asset or right or setting up an exchange relationship, as applicable, by submitting the formalization procedures of the contract to our management.\nThe Independent Committee will operate on a non-permanent basis and will be installed by the Board of Directors whenever it becomes aware of a possible transaction with a related party, with the Independent Committee itself being responsible for approving internal regulations detailing its operation.\nCurrently the Independent Committee is not installed.\nThe Regulation is available on our website (https:/ /www.engie.com.br/investidores/governanca-corporativa/estatutosocial-codigos-e-politicas).",
  "The Board of Directors approved at the 218th Meeting, held on April 27, 2021, the Policy for Transactions with Related Parties ('Related Party Policy'), applicable to the Company, all of subsidiaries, shareholders, members of the Board of Directors and members of advisory committees, and which must be observed by employees, statutory officers and workers when carrying out transactions with them on the Company's behalf.\nFor the purposes of this section, under the terms of the Related Parties Policy, the following are considered as related parties of the Company: (a) the natural person, or close member of the family of such person, who (i) controls the Company , fully or on a shared basis, directly or indirectly; (ii) has significant influence over the Company; and/or (iii) is a member of the key personnel of the Company's Management, Subsidiaries or Controlling Entity; (b) the legal entity,\nwhich (i) is Controlled by the Company, or is Controlled by a person identified in item (a), fully or on a shared basis, directly or indirectly; (ii) is under common Control with the Company; (iii) is one of the Company's affiliates or members of its economic group; (iv) holds, directly or indirectly, a stake in a joint venture, as defined in CPC 05, with the Company or with members of the Company's economic group; (v) is a key person in the Company's Management, Subsidiaries or Controlling Entity; (vi) has as a key person in the Company's Management as set out in item (a)(i) above or is under the significant influence of a person set out in item (a)(i) above; (vii) manage post-employment benefit plan whose beneficiaries are employees of both entities, on the one hand, the Company (or any company in the economic group) and, on the other hand, that Related Party; and/or (viii) the Controlling Entity holds a relevant interest, as from twenty percent (20%), in any of the Company's investees and is not a member of the economic group.\nThe Related Party Policy provides for the possibility of carrying out transactions with related parties and the main guidelines are: (i) negotiation and engagement under market conditions; (ii) negotiation in the manner provided for in the Regulations of the Independent Special Committee, free from Conflicts of Interest between Related Parties; and (iii) entered into in writing specifying its main characteristics and conditions.\nTransactions with Related Parties carried out under conditions other than Market Conditions or that are not related to the corporate purpose and/or without observing the limits set out in the Bylaws and other rules established by the Company's management are prohibited. Transactions with Related Parties are also prohibited in the following cases, except  in  the  case  of  a  decision  to  the  contrary  by  the  competent  bodies:  (i)  granting  of  loans  or  guarantees  to individuals or individuals with significant influence in the Company, key personnel of the Company's Management, as well as the Company's Management Controlling Entity; (ii) transactions that do not include regular activities commonly carried  out  by  Related  Parties  and  Close  Members  of  their  Family  in  the  normal  course  of  their  business;  (iii) transactions that contain forms of remuneration for advisors, consultants or intermediaries that create a conflict of individual interests of these people with the  Company; and/or (iv) transactions with the participation of employees, key personnel of the Management, close members of their family, in business of a private or personal nature that interfere or conflict with the Company's interests or result from the use of confidential information obtained due to of the position or function they take with the Company.",
  "Under the terms of the Related Parties Policy, the Company understands that a conflict of interest between Related Parties means a potential or actual situation in which one of the Related Parties with decision-making power or the power to command or actively participate in transactions and negotiations involving the Company actually participates in its negotiation or approval by the Company, although it may have its own direct or indirect interests conflicting and irreconcilable with our interests, which could impact the exercise of powers and rights concerning the Company, to the detriment of the Company's interests. A conflict of interest will not be presumed when the Related Party that could have  a  conflict  of  interest  does  not  act  simultaneously  for  both  parties  in  the  negotiation  or  in  approving  the transaction. Furthermore, there will be no conflict of interest between Related Parties (a) if the specific transaction or situation has been submitted to the Board of Directors and it has acknowledged the non-existence of a conflict of interest in the specific case; or (b) when the negotiation or approval of the Related Party in the transaction is admitted by the applicable legal and regulatory rules, or by CVM case law.\nGiven  the  potential  conflict  of  interests  in  these  situations,  the  Company  seeks  to  ensure  that  all  decisions  or recommendations that may confer a private benefit to any of its shareholders, members of the Board of Directors, members of Committees, family members, investee companies, or persons related to them are taken with complete transparency.\nIn conjunction with the fact that we are part of an industry of the economy with a strong presence of the regulatory body, we and our subsidiaries operate to mitigate possible conflicts of interest, through their governance policies ensured by the Independent Special Committee. Considering  that  the  Company  operates  in  the  electricity  industry,  legal  transactions  carried  out  between concessionaires, permit holders, and authorized agents and the parties related to them must be subject to the prior consent of Aneel and failure to comply with this requirement may result in the imposition of penalties. Transactions with the Company's related parties mainly comprise: (i) purchase and sale of energy; (ii) plant operation and maintenance services; (iii) provision of administrative services; and (iv) guarantees granted to third parties; and (v) guarantees and suretyships.

Engie Brasil's FC IDR is constrained by Brazil's Country Ceiling of 'BB+', while Brazil's operating environment anchors the LC IDR.",
  "Robust Business Profile: Engie Brasil's ratings benefit from a strong business position in the electric power generation segment in Brazil. It is the second-largest energy generation company in the country, with a total installed capacity of 9.3 GW, to be expanded to 10.7GW in 2025 with the conclusion of new projects. The company has a successful track record in its commercial strategy and monthly allocation of assured capacity. It also benefits from the diluted operational risks due to its diversified asset base.\nThe transmission segment provides further diversification and improves predictability to operating cash flow. Engie Brasil has 2,710 km of transmission lines in operation and 1,780 km under development, to be concluded by 2029. Permitted annual revenues of BRL771 million in this segment should represent roughly 10% of consolidated EBITDA in 2025.\nHigh Capex Pressures FCF: The base case scenario for the ratings considers high investments of BRL8.3 billion, mainly concentrated in 2025, and strong dividend distribution, which will pressure Engie Brasil's FCF. Fitch estimates EBITDA of BRL6.9 billion in 2025 and BRL7.0 billion in 2026, and cash flow from operations (CFFO) of BRL4.1 billion in 2025 and BRL4.0 billion in 2026, with negative FCF of BRL1.9 billion in 2025 and positive FCF of BRL190 million in 2026.\nFitch expects the EBITDA margin to increase over the next few years, reaching 65% in 2025, due to reduced energy purchase expenses with the new generation projects conclusion. The base case scenario anticipates sales of 4.7 average GW (aGW) in 2025 and 4.8 aGW in 2026, with average tariffs of BRL232/MWh and BRL226/MWh, respectively.\nLeverage Expected to Peak in 2025: Fitch estimates Engie Brasil's net leverage ratio will reach 3.2x in 2025, up from 2.3x in 2023 and an expected 3.0x in 2024. These ratios remain consistent with the current LC IDR. A reduction in dividends received from Transportadora Associada de Gás S.A. (TAG) to roughly BRL151 million in 2025 from BRL583 million in 2024 will negatively affect leverage ratios in 2025.\nThe net debt-to-EBITDA ratio should begin to approach 3.0x from 2026 onward. The company has a positive track record in capital structure management, which has included reducing dividend distribution in the past.\nManageable Hydrologic and Curtailment Risks: Fitch estimates Engie Brasil's uncontracted energy volumes of 16% in 2025 and 19% in 2026 would be sufficient to support the expected generating scaling factor (GSF) of 0.89 and 0.91 in the same years, respectively. If needed, Engie Brasil has to obtain energy purchase contracts at prices compatible with those established in sales contracts to cover the reduction in its own generation to avoid higher negative impacts on cash generation.\nThe company has protection against hydrological risk in contracts in the regulated market, which represents approximately 35% of the energy sold and limits its assured energy exposure to GSF to 31%. A diversified asset base also mitigates curtailment impact, with 10% constrained off in renewables plants considered manageable for the group.\nExposure to Repricing and Concession Risk in the Medium Term: Engie Brasil's uncontracted position above 35% from 2028 onward represents a pricing risk in the medium term. The base case scenario for the ratings incorporates average prices of BRL210/MWh for new contracts from 2028 onward, less than BRL256/MWh for the current contracts.\nIn addition, important concessions, which totals 3.9GW and represents 43% of the company current installed capacity, expire during 2030-2032. Fitch believes the group still has time to manage these exposures and expects potential impacts in the cash flow, capital structure or liquidity position to be addressed in advance.\nWeak Parent-Subsidiary Linkage: Engie Brasil's ratings are based on its Standalone Credit Profile, as legal, operational and strategic incentives for parent company Engie S.A. (Engie, BBB+/Stable) to support the Brazilian subsidiary, if needed, are weak. Engie controls 68.71% of Engie Brasil, but there are no guarantees or cross-default clauses.",
  "Strategic incentives of support are low as Engie Brasil represents less than 10% of the group's EBITDA despite being the largest market outside Europe and having some growth potential. Fitch views operational incentives as low to medium, with some reputational risks related to the use of a common name. Engie Brasil's FC IDR (BB+/Stable) is one to two notches below peers in Latin America, such as Engie Energia Chile S.A. (Engie Chile; BBB/Stable), the fourth-largest generator in Chile; Enel Colombia S.A. E.S.P. (Enel Colombia; BBB/Stable), the second-largest generation company in Colombia; and AES Andes S.A. (AES Andes; BBB-/Stable), the second-largest generator in Chile and one of the leaders in Colombia. This is primarily as a result of Brazil's 'BB+' Country Ceiling.\nEngie Chile, Enel Colombia and AES Andes benefit from better economic environments in Chile and Colombia, which are rated higher than Brazil. Engie Brasil's FC IDR is capped by the Brazilian Country Ceiling.\nEngie Brasil's LC IDR (BBB-/Stable) is more comparable with these 'BBB' category rated peers. It is well positioned relative to other Latin American power generators in terms of installed capacity, asset diversification and contracted position. Engie Brasil has an installed capacity of approximately 9.3GW, which compares favorably with AES Andes (6.1GW), Engie Chile (2.5GW) and Enel Colombia (4.3GW).\nThe energy mix of Engie Chile and AES Andes differs from Engie Brasil and Enel Colombia. Engie Brasil and Enel Colombia are more exposed to hydrological conditions, while AES Andes and Engie Chile need to deal with coal and natural gas price volatility. All the companies have predictable and robust cash flow generation since they have managed business risks properly. However, Engie Brasil has a stronger financial profile.\nCompared with European integrated groups with operations in Brazil, Engie Brasil's FC and LC IDRs are also two to three notches below Enel S.p.A. (BBB+/Stable) and Iberdrola, S.A. (Iberdrola; BBB+/Stable). The two European companies benefit from international footprints with large presences in higher-rated geographies - the U.K. and U.S. for Iberdrola, and Italy for Enel S.p.A. Both are fully integrated utilities that benefit from diversified profiles by business line and geography, with a significant portion of regulated networks and quasi-regulated renewable generation.\nIn energy generation, both Enel S.p.A. and Iberdrola have much higher scale compared with Engie Brasil. Iberdrola has installed capacity of 55GW and Enel S.p.A. has 81GW.",

  "Engie Brasil has ample access to funding sources and a strong liquidity profile, with robust cash position and no short-term debt concentration. As of Sept, 2024, cash and marketable securities of BRL4.0 billion, net of restricted cash of BRL384 million, were strong enough to cover the short-term debt of BRL2.8 billion. The high cash balance, reinforced by capex financing, will be partially used to fund the negative FCF in 2025.\nThe Asa Branca and Grauna project will require capex of BRL3.8 billion in 2025 and 2026, mostly supported by long-term project finance debt at the holding Engie Brasil level. The BRL1.5 billion debentures raised in October 2024 due in 2030 will be mainly used for capex. As of Sept. 2024, Engie Brasil's total debt of BRL24.0 billion was mainly comprised of Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econônico e Social (BNDES) (BRL10.8 billion) and debentures (BRL9.0 billion). Engie Brasil is the second-largest energy generator in Brazil, with a total operational installed capacity of 9.3GW and 1.4GW under development. The company also has 2,710 km of transmission lines in operation and 1,780 km in the pre-operational phase. Net revenues and EBITDA net of construction revenues and cost.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any thirdparty verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. Fitch Ratings makes routine, commonly-accepted adjustments to reported financial data in accordance with the relevant criteria and/or industry standards to provide financial metric consistency for entities in the same sector or asset class.",

  "[GRI 2-22]\nIn 2023, we celebrated ENGIE Brasil Energia's 25 years of existence: a quarter of a century during which the world, the country and the businesses changed at breakneck speed . A transformation driven by technological revolution and fresh dynamics of production, consumption, work, and interaction combined with the growing - and necessary - preoccupation with sustainability.\nWe are proud to have seen our Company not only accompanying this movement but also how each challenge - inherent to any change - has been transformed into a major opportunity for multiplying results, developing resilience, innovating, and generating a positive impact on people and the planet . Together, our discipline and long-term vision have enabled us to meet the challenge of volatility in the business environment and contribute to the gradual evolution of the Brazilian electric power sector: achievements completely aligned with acting to accelerate the transition to a carbon neutral economy , a proposal which guides the ENGIE Group worldwide.\nIn this context, our evolution has been impressive: from 3.7 GW of hydrothermal generation capacity in 1998 to 8.3 GW of proprietary installed capacity, 100% renewable, and with broad-based diversification of sources . This has only been made possible because our teams have dedicated themselves intensely over time to integrating hydro sources into the energy matrix, testing, and implementing new technologies, restructuring the business, and expanding the operations - mainly through entry into the transmission segment. And we have grown, supporting the sustainable development of the country.\nThus, we come to the end of 2023, which will be marked in our history as the year in which we successfully concluded our exit from coal-fired operations, lifting ENGIE Brasil Energia to the position as the largest 100% renewable generator in the country .\nAnd we do not intend to stop there. After investing R$ 22 billion in the expansion of renewables and transmission over the past eight years, our forecast is to invest at least another R$ 14 billion by 2026 in wind and photovoltaic complexes, and also a new transmission system.\nWe are working daily to generate and share value in a sustainable manner - and we are convinced that there is no other way but to focus on ESG. Consequently, in 2023 we enhanced our Journey for the Climate, a program aimed at providing structured guidance on actions and targets for mitigating and adapting to climate change . On another front, we made efforts to verify the stage of maturity of our suppliers in relation to ESG in order to support these companies - of different sizes and sectors - in the continuous improvement of good socio-environmental and governance practices. Internally, we have maintained initiatives to ensure a healthy, safe, and truly inclusive working environment that fosters development and prosperity .\n4\nThe year's achievements at ENGIE Brasil ENERGIA were reflected in the 4.7% growth in adjusted Ebitda and 23.8% in the adjusted net income, compared to 2022 and  encourage us to forecast an even more promising future. As from January 2024, the opening of the Free Energy Market to companies linked into the high and medium voltage network, will reinforce our purpose, permitting us to contribute to the decarbonization of an increasing number of customers . Confident in the expansion of this market - where consumption increased 10% in 2023 - the Company is maintaining its rate of investment, alert to the sectorial scenario, which has been indicating a need for regulatory adjustments in our business environment.\nWe have sought to contribute proactively with change so that the full potential of Brazil in generating accessible, competitive, reliable, and sustainable energy can become a reality, driving domestic socio-economic development. We continue believing that the country represents an agent relevant to a global carbon-neutral economy - a transition which is increasingly more urgent for tackling climate change and its impacts, which transcend frontiers .\nWe wish to thank all, both individuals and institutions, which have been supporting this mission over the past 25 years and believe in the capacity of ENGIE Brasil Energia to deliver sustainable results with discipline, consistency and absolute respect for people and the planet.\nMaurício Stolle Bähr Chairman of the Board of Directors\nEduardo Antonio Gori Sattamini Chief Executive Officer\nEduardo Antonio Gori Sattamini\n5\nI\nN T\nR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nT\nI\nO\nN",

  "[ 2030 Agenda Goal: 16.6]\nCommitted to sustainable development, ENGIE Brasil Energia ('ENGIE Brasil Energia' or 'Company') operates in all regions of Brazil in the activities of generation, commercialization, trading, and transmission of electric power . In 2023, it reached the position as the largest generator of 100% renewable electric power in the country, after concluding the sale of the last thermoelectric energy plant in its generator complex. With this, it strengthened its purpose to act in order to accelerate the transition to a carbonneutral economy. [GRI 2-6]\nWith its headquarters in Florianópolis (SC), at the end of the year the Company was operating with 81 plants powered 100% from renewables, amounting to a proprietary installed capacity of more than 8.3 GW. New projects being implemented are set to add about 2 GW to this existing capacity : the Santo Agostinho Wind Complex in Rio Grande do Norte with 434 MW (of which 320 MW were already operating at the end of 2023), the Assú Sol Photovoltaic Complex in Rio Grande do Norte, with 752 MW and the Serra do Assuruá Wind Complex in Bahia, with 846 MW - this the largest wind complex that ENGIE has ever constructed in Brazil and the world. [GRI 2-1]\nENGIE Brasil Energia's activities also gained further significance in the transmission segment as part of the strategy of portfolio diversification and investment in infrastructure for the offtake of renewable energy, thus contributing to a secure and accessible energy transition. In 2023, the Company concluded the energization of the Gralha Azul, Paraná, and Novo Estado projects, the latter in the states of Tocantins and Pará . T ogether, both represent the entry into operation of 2,709 kilometers of transmission lines reaching an extremely high degree of uptime in the period of 99.95%. [GRI 2-6]\nIn this segment, during the year, the Company continued work on Gavião Real Transmissora de Energia, which will also link into  the Pará distribution network. At the same time, it was preparing for the implementation of another major project which was auctioned off in\nJune 2023, the Asa Branca Transmission System . Traversing three states - Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Espírito Santo - this project will guarantee a strategic position for the flow of renewable energy generated in the Northeast to the Southeast and Central-Western region of the country. See more on projects in implementation on page 19. [GRI 2-6]\nAs a complement to its operations in the electricity sector, ENGIE Brasil Energia has a stake in Transportadora Associada de Gás (TAG), which owns the longest natural gas pipeline network in the country, covering 4,500 kilometers . The presence in this segment also drives the fulfillment of ENGIE's purpose, natural gas representing a fuel critical to the energy transition. Natural gas can be used as backup for intermittent sources such as solar and wind power, providing security for supply systems, as well as being a significantly less polluting alternative to coal and fuel oil, both in electricity generation and in industry.

  "[2030 Agenda Goals: 7.2]\nConsidered an important element of the energy systems of the future, hydrogen will be essential for the transition to a low-carbon economy. When produced by electrolysis using renewable energy, the gas emits no CO2 and is known as green hydrogen. It can be used as an energy vector, fuel or industrial input. Thus, hydrogen represents a viable alternative for the energy transition in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, such as heavy transportation, the chemical industry, the steel industry, among others.\nIn its early stages in Brazil, this segment has much potential for development in the country, given the nature of the national electricity matrix, which is predominantly renewable and abundant . According to experts, other factors that could contribute to Brazil's leading role in this area are the integrated low-carbon electricity grid, potential demand from local industry and its geographical position, which would facilitate exports to Europe and other regions of the world via the country's port infrastructure.\nThese factors make Brazil a potential protagonist in this emerging industry, very much in line with the ENGIE Group's strategy for the segment.

The focus is on increasing the recycling rate of waste generated by industrial activities and identifying ways of recycling materials used in solar and wind generation.\nIn this regard, the following initiatives were highlighted in 2023:\n⬤ Recycling photovoltaic panels: Despite their long lifespan, photovoltaic panels may require early replacement due to cracks and fissures in the cells (compromising their efficiency), an impact that has been identified on a global scale. Destined for recycling, the replaced parts, which are made up of high value-\nadded materials, are transformed into components for new modules, or for use in other sectors of industry. Since 2022, in partnership with a Brazilian startup that is a pioneer in Latin America in the complete recycling of photovoltaic panels, the Company has recycled more than 300 tons of panels, achieving a 99% efficiency rate in the reuse of this material and thus avoiding final disposal in industrial landfills .",
  "The stationary batteries used in the solar trackers of photovoltaic plants and generators in general, when unserviceable, are 100% recycled through a reverse logistics process. When they return to their source, the materials are separated and crushed for later reuse in the battery supplier's manufacturing process. In 2023, more than 12 tons of batteries were sent for recycling.\n⬤ Reuse of electrical and electronic equipment: Since 2020, the Company has\nbeen working towards the digital inclusion of communities by donating laptops and computers that have been replaced at its facilities.

  "Classified among the 10 main groups of risks to be managed by ENGIE Brasil Energia, climate risk requires a methodology of comprehensive and transversal assessment. As such, the management process is aligned with the ENGIE Group's guidelines - based on Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and ISO 31000 - and involves, in addition to Senior Management, the Audit Committee, the Corporate Risk Management Forum, Governance, Risks and Internal Controls Management, Environment and Climate Management and Investor Relations, among other areas.\nmultidisciplinary technical climate risk group, and is disclosed annually in a report sent to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The process involves assessing the physical and transition risks of the assets belonging to ENGIE Brasil Energia, as well as any possible impacts on the business or surroundings, evaluating the vulnerability, exposure, and resilience of the assets in the face of the main extreme weather events.\nThe climate risk analysis also considers the different ways in which the Company's supply chains, infrastructures and activities could be affected by the greater incidence of extreme weather events such as droughts, fires, storms, excessive rainfall and floods. In the context of new investments, in order to ensure the sustainability of these projects, a matrix analysis of ESG aspects is performed, including mitigation and adaptation criteria, covering short-, medium- and long-term objectives set by the ENGIE Group . Added to this assessment are the risks connected to changes in technological and social structures demanded by the energy transition, which can increase the resilience of the business model, as well as the capacity for innovation.\nThe assessment and management of climate risks adheres to the recommendations of the Task-Force Climate Financial Disclosure (TCFD) , involving different areas of the Company meeting as a single\nBased on the risks identified, Climate Change Adaptation Plans were drawn up, providing for a set of strategies and actions developed to manage the impacts and risks associated with climate change, considering projections and multiple possible futures. In this way, the plans support the Company's preparation to respond effectively to changes in environmental conditions caused by climate change.\nIn 2023, ENGIE Brasil Energia began drawing up adaptation plans for each asset, considering the risks, causes, consequences and financial impacts of the effects of climate change, among other aspects . Over the course of 2024, new risks and opportunities will be assessed, with those considered critical for the Company being monetized.

  "In order to further analyze the impacts of climate change on ENGIE Brasil Energia's assets, studies are carried out on a local and regional scale. Based on the methodology for analyzing and identifying climate risks developed by the Parent Company, the indicators have been adapted to more accurately represent Brazil's climate reality.\nHeat waves, extreme winds, floods, landslides, and water stress are the main extreme weather events assessed in the risk analysis. For each of the indicators used to characterize these events, adaptations were made for the regional context, using historical data series recorded by weather stations of the National Meteorological Institute (INMET).\nThe studies also include official databases from Brazilian bodies such as the National Water Agency (ANA), the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and AdaptaBrasil - Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). The aim is to guarantee the resilience of activities over time, the integrity of physical facilities, support for the surrounding regions and employee health and safety.\nAfter identifying the level of local exposure, the asset's sensitivity to extreme weather events is investigated. The combination of exposure and sensitivity assessed determines the actions to be incorporated into the asset's adaptation plan.

  "Customer management at ENGIE Brasil Energia has two strategic roles: to retain existing customers, based on a satisfactory commercial journey, and to maintain the Company's competitiveness, to attract other potential customers . The relevance of this work has increased with the expectations surrounding the liberalizing of the Free Contracting Environment (ACL) to all highvoltage consumers - with the potential for adding more than one hundred thousand new customers. [GRI 3-3]\nIn 2023, the Company recorded a significant increase in the number of ACL customers, from 982 to 1,408, an increase of 43% over the previous year , reflecting the gradual liberalizing of the market in recent years, coupled with efforts to capture and expand market share. The decrease in the volume of energy registered in the same period is mainly due to the lower volume of energy purchases, and consequently, the lower volume available for sale.\n[GRI 2-6/semicolon.case.tf G4-EU3/semicolon.case.tf SASB IF-EU-000.A]\nAmong the strategies adopted by ENGIE Brasil Energia is the acceleration of migration of companies to the ACL through digital solutions that facilitate the interaction of agents and automate the contracting of energy. E-conomiza, for example, is a product line for consumers looking to reduce costs. Through it, the process of migrating to the ACL has been simplified, especially for small- and medium-sized companies. Another advantage is that it increases the autonomy of these consumers, allowing them to selfmanage energy supplies required for their businesses. [GRI 3-3]\nAlso noteworthy is Energy Place, a digital platform created by ENGIE Brasil Energia to function as an energy e-commerce for all ACL agents . Here you can quote and buy short- and long-term energy and manage contracts and seasonalization strategies in a practical, agile and 100% digital manner.\nAnother initiative aimed at more effective customer management was the expansion of service channels in order to strengthen the relationship with the end customer. In addition to service via chat and messaging applications, ENGIE Brasil Energia has added new partners to the chain of representatives it has distributed throughout the country to generate business in the Free Energy Market. The aim is to increase sales capillarity and  accessibility to a  more personalized service. [GRI 2-29/semicolon.case.tf 3-3]\nThe Company has also implemented a Customer Success project, which, among other measures, includes a monthly survey of customer samples to identify opportunities for improvement and support the planning of new actions. Each customer responds to the survey once a year. The satisfaction rate in 2023 was 93.5%, 2.5 p.p. higher than in 2022 .\nIn addition to facilitating the acquisition of energy on the ACL, ENGIE Brasil Energia positions itself as a partner and supporter of companies seeking to decarbonize their\noperations . T o this end, it offers solutions to offset emissions identified in the GHG Emissions Inventories, in three scopes: direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions from the purchase of energy (Scope 2) and indirect emissions from sources over which the Company has no control (Scope 3).\nThe main solutions available for customer decarbonization are:\n⬤ I-RECs (Renewable Energy Certificates): certifies that electricity consumption is from renewable sources, with no GHG emissions. The certificate is internationally recognized and can be used to neutralize Scope 2 emissions.",
  "Certificates): allows free consumers, mainly large industrial or commercial companies, to sign a contract with ENGIE to guarantee that the energy consumed in their operations is being generated by a renewable source, free of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With this, the consuming company can zero out Scope 2 emissions in its Inventory.\n⬤ Carbon credits: allow direct and indirect GHG emissions from scopes 1, 2 and 3 to be offset, including from periods prior to the current year of the GHG inventory. In 2023, 1,238,487 carbon credits were issued to the UNFCCC, linked to the Trairi wind project, which the Company can sell in the future.\nIn order to boost access to credits for small- and medium-sized companies, the Company this year signed its first venture capital investment contract in a start-up operation focused on this solution. The startup, Descarbonize, is a platform focused on services for neutralizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by offsetting emissions with UN-certified carbon credits. The platform is integrated to automate and simplify the calculation and management of the annual emissions of small- and mediumsized companies, with solutions also for neutralizing events. Aware of the importance that suppliers of goods and services have in mitigating impacts and risks, as well as in meeting the commitments made in relation to ethics and social responsibility, ENGIE seeks to continuously improve its relationship with this group of stakeholders to strengthen sustainability practices throughout the value chain.\nIn 2023, one of the main initiatives in this regard was the application of a survey among suppliers to broaden understanding of their ESG policies and practices . A questionnaire responded via digital platform and supported by the provision of evidence revealed challenges in relation to the environment, health and safety, human rights and ethics, among other aspects. [GRI 2-29; 3-3]",
  "Supplier management is of great importance in achieving the targets set by ENGIE Brasil Energia in its Journey for the Climate. In this context, the Supplier Decarbonization Program was established, aimed at reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions and intended to engage 100% of the Company's main suppliers - which account for 80% of Scope 3 emissions - to define their decarbonization and mitgation targets up to 2030. [GRI 308-2]\nIn 2023, webinars were held with the participation of suppliers, which amounted to approximately 60% of the Company's spend in the reference year of 2022, to raise awareness and engage suppliers in the ESG agenda. As well as addressing the climate issue, the events covered biodiversity, social responsibility, governance, ethics, sustainable purchasing and human rights. At the assets operated by the Company, quarterly meetings are also held with local suppliers to engage them in the ESG agenda.\nThe Company has begun developing a more detailed program for managing ESG aspects in its supply chain to boost its ongoing actions , and to be monitored by the Sustainability Committee.

[GRI 3-3]\nThe health and safety score is also given a minimum weight in these selection processes to ensure that those with the best performance in this area are given preference in contracts awarded. The data helps to understand the level of maturity of each supplier in relation to the ESG agenda and to plan actions aimed at the continuous development of these partners.\nExternal audits of ISO certifications (9001, 14001, 45001) cover both the purchasing and supplier management process, as well as the activities carried out by service providers in the context of certified processes and assets (see scope of certifications on page 33).\nIn addition to the new research dynamic that began in 2023, ENGIE Brasil Energia already had mechanisms for evaluating and managing suppliers based on its Due Diligence Policy . This reflects the practices of the ENGIE Group, with measures that seek to mitigate risks of corruption and other deviations from the Company's environmental and human rights policies. In summary, this system includes: [GRI 308-1; 414-1]\n⬤ Prior ethical analysis on the entry of any new supplier , executed using an automated platform with big data resources, covering, among other things, environmental, social and ethical aspects (including measures involving embargos against countries deemed a risk, under the terms of the Company's and the ENGIE Group's Embargo Policy). The previous ethical analysis is reapplied across the entire supplier base on an annual basis.\n⬤ Quarterly assessment of long-term or critical suppliers , when they provide services within ENGIE Brasil Energia's facilities, covering four approaches: commercial, social, environmental and health and safety. The assessment is carried out by\nCompany teams, who directly monitor the execution of the activities. In the event of poor performance, action plans are drawn up to address the points of correction and identified improvements, with the support and monitoring of the Company.",
  "⬤ Evaluation conducted by an independent external company and with greater in-depth criteria for the \"top 50\" suppliers , which receive larger volumes of funds in the year, observing criteria such as: convictions for acts of improbity, association with slave labor, notification in registers of unfit or punished companies, processes linked to environmental violations, among others;\n⬤ Reputation monitoring , using the \"RepRisk\" tool, for two supplier profiles: long-term suppliers and those receiving larger volumes of funds.\nUnsatisfactory results in any of the abovementioned stages of analysis disqualify the supplier from joining or remaining on the Company's list of business partners. Committed to promoting human rights, ENGIE Brasil Energia does not tolerate the exploitation of child, forced or compulsory labor under any circumstances. As such, it refuses to enter into commercial relations with organizations involved in such practices and is instructed to report any cases of which it becomes aware to the competent bodies.\nThe conduct expected of employees, suppliers and partners in relation to this issue is described in ENGIE Brasil Energia's Human Rights Policy and Code of Ethics , which are widely disseminated to all stakeholders and accessible on the Company's website. [GRI 308-1/semicolon.case.tf 414-1]\nSupplier management initiatives are supported by ENGIE Brasil Energia's governance structure, policies, and guidelines. In 2023, the Company published the Code of Conduct on Supplier Relations , a document that internalizes, with some adaptations, the guidelines already adopted by the ENGIE Group, in order to guide ethical standards, ensuring compliance in these relationships. Other commitments and expectations relating to suppliers are set out in the Procurement Policy. [GRI 2-24; 3-3]\nThe guidelines clarify that potential suppliers must be aligned with the Company's ethics and compliance principles as well as ensuring that they respect these commitments within their own supply chains, seeking ways to ensure that their own suppliers comply with the established requirements. In addition, the contracts signed by the Company include clauses on ethics, the environment and social responsibility, which formalize the alignment required of contractors with the values and commitments assumed by the Company in its Code of Ethics, Sustainable Management Policy, and other applicable guidelines.\nSupplier management procedures are continually reviewed to ensure alignment with the Supplier Relations Code of Conduct and to avoid conflicts with ESG requirements.

The aim is to promote gender equity based on four fundamental pillars: education, health, income generation and combating domestic violence.\nIn each edition, the Company makes financial transfers to support businesses led by women (cisgender and transgender) and offers free training in entrepreneurial education and business management.\nThe program also includes guidance on support networks, physical and mental health support and awareness-raising actions to combat violence.\nIn 2023, ENGIE launched the 4th Women of Our Neighborhood call for proposals, the largest since the program's inception. In all, 93 projects were selected to receive a financial incentive of R$10,000 each . In addition to supporting a significantly larger number of projects (in 2022, 36 initiatives were contemplated), the new call for proposals focused on the empowerment of black women , prioritizing businesses led by candidates declaring themselves to be black.\nThe scope of the Program was another highlight of the 4th edition: 23 Brazilian states had initiatives considered. One of the reasons for such a wide reach is that Women of Our Neighborhood is supported by  the Goodwill Partnerships Program, another ENGIE Brasil Energia program, created to broaden the public impacted by its social initiatives (more details to follow).\nThe partners in the Program's 4th Call were: WEG, Goedert Group, Fort Atacadista, Portonave, Instituto Consulado da Mulher, Whirlpool Corporation, Voltalia, Jirau Energia, TAG - Transportadora Associada de Gás, Sebrae, Irani, Delas and Oiapoque Energia.

They are managed by the communities themselves, through local associations, autonomously and independent of government and ENGIE.\nAt the end of 2023, five centers were in operation (see map) and three were under construction : Trairi (CE), scheduled to open at the end of the first half of 2024, Saudade do Iguaçu (PR) and Itá (SC). It is estimated that more than half a million people have already visited the centers as well as more than 4,000 young people having been served by fully operational units in one form\nAs well as democratizing access to culture, the Centers promote the appreciation of local customs and traditions and social and digital inclusion. Consequently, they contribute to generating jobs and income and reducing urban and rural depopulation, especially among young people.

  "Another way ENGIE Brasil Energia has found to increase opportunities to support communities is Capacitar . The program, which has been in existence since 2016, offers free training to public and private entities, third sector organizations and community leaders in the municipalities in the area of influence of the Company's assets, so that these stakeholders understand and know how to use tax incentive mechanisms such as the Rouanet Law, the Sports Incentive Law, the  Fund for the Elderly and the Childhood and Adolescence Fund.\nDespite having as a guideline prioritizing these communities when allocating funds, ENGIE Brasil Energia is often faced with a shortage of projects suitable for funding. Through Capacitar, communities are empowered to formalize and implement ideas that directly benefit their populations, enabling them to render the Company's investments viable in these locations .\nThe program also raises awareness among personal taxpayers as to the possibility of contributing part of their tax bill to social causes. In all, Capacitar has already provided 40 training initiatives, including online and face-to-face courses and lectures, covering more than 10,000 participants in 13 Brazilian states. Around 6,000 program booklets have already been distributed.\nIn 2023, four training sessions were held, involving an audience of around 320 people.

  "Aware that volunteering not only transforms social reality, but also brings a number of benefits to those who practice it, ENGIE Brasil Energia maintains initiatives to encourage volunteer work among its employees. And in order to coordinate its campaigns and projects more effectively and thus increase the engagement of its teams, it launched the Volunteer Program at the end of 2023 .\nEven a short time after its launch, the Program already had 68 employees engaged in 243 hours of volunteering. On another front, the Voluntary Energy campaign was continued. Since 2018, this has encouraged employees to make tax-deductible donations to socio-cultural projects or entities, such as nurseries, orphanages, hospitals and homes for the elderly . By 2023, more than R$700,000 had been raised under this initiative. The implementation of assets has a significant impact on local communities, including boosting the local economy, generating jobs, taxes, and income, while at the same time leading to an increase in population, heavy vehicle traffic, noise and temporary overloading of public services and equipment, among other consequences. This is the reason why this phase of the projects requires a closer look at the demands and opportunities for support mapped out with local stakeholders.

  "For ENGIE Brasil Energia, effective stakeholder management is an essential tool in the design and execution of corporate strategy, not only because it makes it possible to manage a series of risks, but also because it is possible to capture opportunities on different fronts - from the diverse perspectives that characterize the\nbroad spectrum of stakeholders with whom the Company relates. By being consulted and engaged, each of these stakeholders contributes to the continuous improvement of policies and practices.\nIn this sense, openness to dialog plays a fundamental role, reflected both in the\nprovision of information of interest to stakeholders and in active listening to their perceptions . T o this end, ENGIE Brasil Energia maintains structured organizational communication practices.\nVarious communication platforms seek both to keep the public properly informed\nabout the Company's activities and to capture their requirements . Employees, for example, can rely on content disseminated via the intranet portal, newsletter and internal social networks, special campaigns, events and a range of information materials. Frequent climate surveys (ENGIE & ME see Chapter 4), meetings with leaders and\nfocus groups with specialists in the People Management and Culture areas are also mediums for listening to audiences in the local community. [GRI 2-29]\nIntegrated in the local communities, employees take part in the Sustainability Panels held to engage the population of the regions in which the Company operates. The last edition of the Panels, held in 2022, covered nine municipalities - eight in the area of influence of hydropower plants and one in Florianópolis, in the state of Santa Catarina, where the Company's head office is located. Together, these events brought together around 430 people - 30% of whom were employees, both direct and outsourced. In addition to the inhouse public, community leaders, educators, local suppliers, and representatives of third sector entities and bodies were invited to indicate the positive and negative impacts of the presence of the Company in each territory, as well as its potential to contribute to sustainable development. In parallel to the panels, individual interviews were held with other members of these communities - especially local government managers - to broaden the listening process.

[GRI 2-25; 2-29]\nStructured dialogs with communities, usually held every two years, are added to other ongoing interaction platforms, both in operational assets and in projects under implementation. These platforms include ombudsmen - accessible by phone, e-mail or messaging apps - toll-free telephone lines and e-mail addresses for contact and clarification of doubts . In addition, field teams and local managers remain attentive to community demands and most of the assets are open to visitors through the Connection Program - see more on Page 82. [GRI 2-25; 2-29]\nIn the assets under implementation - the phase when operations will have the greatest impact on the local community - stakeholder management has been continually improved to ensure that complaints received through the various channels are duly recorded, assessed, and addressed. In addition, the use of technology has boosted this management, through tools that make it possible to analyze data on mapped organizations and interactions with individuals interested in/impacted by the project. Analysis on a case-by-case basis for the records of each interaction and various visual graphics, facilitate decision-making.\nThe success of this model has led to its adoption in projects under implementation, where the relationship with stakeholders begins even before construction starts, through public hearings dedicated to presenting the project to the local community. On another front, environmental education initiatives and social responsibility projects are important platforms for engagement, enabling the external public to learn more about the Company's activities and their impacts. [GRI 2-25; 2-29]\nThese interactions make action plans richer and more assertive, especially socioenvironmental initiatives, based on the demands presented by the people closest to the operations.

The first, which is positive, is that global inflationary pressures, which have haunted the markets in recent years, have cooled, bringing a little more stability to prices. This allows for less restrictive economic and monetary policies in the medium term, which in turn brings economic growth. On the negative side, geopolitical issues, already complex in 2022 due to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, have taken on new contours with conflicts in Israel and neighboring territories, generating more instability and the possibility of new inflationary escalations. The overall scenario was one of very modest economic growth.\nThe Brazilian economy in 2023 performed slightly better than forecast by economists and the market, with more controlled inflation and a cut in interest rates. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 2.9%, helped by the good performance of the formal labor market and agribusiness. The country turned in a super harvest, benefiting from still higher commodity prices on the international stage. While in 2022 most of the contribution to GDP came from industry and services, in\n2023 there was a boost from agribusiness and extractive activities. The industrial and services sectors continued to be affected by continuing high interest rates.\nInflation fell gradually and ended the year at 4.62%, therefore within the target set by the authorities (up to 4.75%). The appreciation of the Real and the commodity price shock, which rose by around 20% in 2022 and fell in 2023, pushed the price index down, as did the increase in food supply. The PTAX dollar ended the year at R$4.84, 7.1% lower than at the end of 2022, when it stood at R$5.21.\nWeakening inflation allowed the Central Bank to begin a downward cycle of reducing Selic rates with the first cut announced in August. Although continuing high, the basic interest rate began 2023 at 13.75% but ended the year at 11.75%, with signs of further easing ahead.\nBy the end of 2023, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew\nand the basic Brazilian interest rate (SELIC) was 11.75% a.a.",
  "The fall in electricity consumption in advanced economies restricted the growth in global energy demand in 2023. Consumption grew by 2.2% in the year, lower than the 2.4% increase seen in 2022. While China, India and several Southeast Asian countries recorded robust increases in consumption, the advanced economies saw substantial falls due to the decelerated macroeconomic environment and high inflation, which reduced industrial production more particularly.\nIn 2023, one of the most debated themes in the area of sustainable economic development, which has renewable energy as a central element, is powershoring, which consists of attracting industries - where energy consumption represents a large component of both cost and negative externality - to locations where low-carbon energy availability is ample, reliable and competitive, in a move to reposition global production chains. Brazil, given its great potential in renewable energies, has sought to position itself globally as a destination for these companies, combining respect for and protection of the environment with economic development. [GRI 201-2]\nIn Brazil, the year was marked by a sharp increase in consumption, due to the heatwaves that swept across the country in the second half of the year and the good performance of some sectors of the economy. According to data from the Energy Research Company (EPE), annual electricity consumption in the country was 531,013 GWh, an increase of 4.2% compared to 2022, when it reached 509,441 GWh. Compared to December 2022, the increase in consumption was 9.1% - growth in both the regulated (8.6%) and free (10.0%) environments.\nResidential consumption grew by 7.6%, commercial consumption by 5.6% and industrial consumption by 2.0%. With regard to the country's regions, the highlights were the above-average increases in the North (7.7%), Northeast (7.5%) and Midwest (5.2%). The South (3.4%) and Southeast (2.7%) recorded more modest increases. The Company participates, either through associations or individually, via formal public consultations, in sector debates with regulatory bodies. Engagement with regulators is always conducted publicly, respecting procedures for interactions with authorities, such as the Code of Ethics and the Guide to Ethical Practices.\nThe Regulatory and Market Affairs Management is responsible for managing sectoral and regulatory debates at ENGIE Brasil Energia, reporting to the Chief Regulation and Market Officer, who is part of the Executive Board. Acting directly or through associations, and always in partnership with the areas responsible for the topics under discussion, its duties include monitoring, analysis, reporting and information on the evolution and critical points of regulatory matters and bills that impacts the Company.\nThe following table lists the main regulatory issues that the company will monitor in 2023. A list of all the associations to which the Company is a member and the amounts spent on contributions to these associations is published in the Complementary Folder.",
  "Green Hydrogen  regulatory  framework (Bill  2.308/23)., Why the topic is important to ENGIE Brasil Energia = The milestone aims to establish the regulatory foundations for low- carbon hydrogen in Brazil, which will influence the development  of the domestic market and its competitiveness in the global  hydrogen market. The ENGIE Group sees great potential in Brazil for  developing the chain.. Green Hydrogen  regulatory  framework (Bill  2.308/23)., Company's position = By monitoring this area, the objective is to leverage  opportunities to develop projects to produce green hydrogen  and its derivatives, both for export and to meet domestic  demand from Brazilian industries seeking to decarbonize their  production processes.. Bill 365/22, Why the topic is important to ENGIE Brasil Energia = PDL 365/22 seeks to suspend Aneel's normative resolutions  for dealing with adjustments to the methodology for allocating  transmission costs in Brazil. Annulling normative resolutions,  drawn up after years of discussion with society, would bring legal  uncertainty to the Brazilian electricity sector.. Bill 365/22, Company's position = ENGIE Brasil Energia supports Aneel in the need to suspend  PDL 365/22, in order to protect the Brazilian electricity  sector, as well as the tariff methodology approved by Aneel,  with a view to better allocating transmission costs in Brazil.. Enhancement of  services rendered  by the hydropower  plants, Why the topic is important to ENGIE Brasil Energia = In addition to generating energy, hydropower plants provide  flexibility and reliability for the electricity system. These attributes,  inherent to the Company's hydropower plants and several others in  the National Interconnected System, are not properly remunerated,  even though they are extremely important in the context of the  growth of intermittent renewable generation sources, such as solar  and wind power.. Enhancement of  services rendered  by the hydropower  plants, Company's position = The company is in favor of additional remuneration for  ancillary services and flexibility that power plants provide in  addition to generating energy.. Export of  hydropower to  Argentina  and  Uruguay, Why the topic is important to ENGIE Brasil Energia = The export of electric energy allows for a reduction in spilled  hydropower from the plants, with corresponding increase in revenue  for Brazil.. Export of  hydropower to  Argentina  and  Uruguay, Company's position = ENGIE Brasil Energia defends the export of spilled  hydropower, providing greater efficiency to the system,  benefits to national entities, and decarbonization - given that  the acquisition in Brazil will reduce the demand for thermal  generation in another country.. Reducing taxes on  products in keeping  with a low-carbon  green economy (Bill  2148/15)., Why the topic is important to ENGIE Brasil Energia = ENGIE Brasil Energia's purpose is to act to accelerate the transition  towards a carbon-neutral society through reduced energy  consumption and more sustainable solutions.  In this way, it remains  alert to market opportunities, consolidating the Company in a  privileged position, in the country and in the world, to respond to  the challenges and opportunities involved in the decarbonization  movement, supporting other companies and sectors to decarbonize  their own operations, through a portfolio of 100% renewable  generation, carbon credits and renewable energy certificates of origin.  The entire framework of products and solutions on offer not only  facilitates the transition to cleaner energy sources, but also promotes  a business ecosystem that is more adherent to sustainable principles.. Reducing taxes on  products in keeping  with a low-carbon  green economy (Bill  2148/15)., Company's position = The Company considers it fundamental, and has worked  with energy sector entities, to create public policies aimed  at establishing a regulated carbon market that will help  Brazil meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement  and also with the objective of limiting the increase in global  temperatures. ENGIE defends the idea of a market of a multi-sector nature,  with an efficient and competitive regulatory governance  structure at a global level, offering legal certainty to users  and transactions. It also supports the creation of properly  regulated technical guidelines and parameters to cover all  generating sources of credits.",
  "In 2023 ENGIE invested around R$1.2 million in associations and research centers in order to take part in discussions on issues in the electricity sector such as the regulatory framework for Green Hydrogen (Bill  2.308/23), the reduction of taxes for products suitable for the green, low-carbon economy (Bill 2148/15), the appropriate signaling of transmission costs in Brazil (PDL 365/22), the valuation of services provided by hydropower plants and the export of hydropower to Argentina and Uruguay. The list of regulatory partners is on page 182 of the Complementary Folder. As in recent years, in 2023 no donations or associations were made to, or entered into with political parties or agents, or to political campaigns of any kind. The Company's Guide to Ethical Practices disapproves of influence peddling and does not tolerate any financing of political activities, even in countries where such financing is authorized and lawful. In Brazil, political donations by legal entities have been prohibited since the passing of Law 13.165 of 2015. [GRI 415-1] Summary: The Company is subject to comprehensive legislation and regulations imposed by the Federal Government (more directly by the Ministry of Mines and Energy), by the National Electric Energy Agency (Aneel), as well as being exposed to the effects of any changes in legislation or regulations currently in force with respect to its business and operating results. The risk is also related to penalties imposed on the Company for non-compliance with any provision of the Company's concession and authorization contracts. Another aspect of the risk is linked to regulations which do not directly affect the Company's business, but which influence the competitiveness of its assets or the sector in general.\nImpacts in the event of materialization: Changes in obtaining authorization to operate assets or sell energy, changes in licensing processes/maintenance of licenses, or operational changes, such as energy production levels that the Company's plants are able to generate.\nThere are also impacts from any penalties the Company may receive - in extreme cases, these could lead to the revoking of the authorization or concession of assets.\nAnother impact is the non-evolution, or involution, of agendas that are not aligned with the Company's purpose of transitioning to a carbon-neutral economy, which may even jeopardize the operationalization of the strategy (see Strategy Operationalization Risk on page 13). ⬤ Proactive action in monitoring and discussing regulations, either through associations or individually, via public consultations. In the 12 months to 2023, considering all scheduled and forced shutdowns, the plants operated by ENGIE Brasil Energia recorded an uptime index of 92.6%, 93.7% for hydropower plants and 87.5% for plants fired from complementary sources . [GRI G4EU30]\nCompared to 2022, there was a reduction of 1.5 p.p. in overall uptime, reflecting a drop of 1.5 p.p. and 0.8 p.p. in the uptime of hydropower plants and complementary plants, respectively. For comparison purposes, the Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Plant was not considered in the light of its disposal in May 2023. [GRI G4-EU30]\nReduced hydropower and complementary plant uptime were largely a reflection of the modernizing work on the Jaguara and Miranda hydropower plants, as well as corrective maintenance on wind turbines at Campo Largo and Umburanas. ENGIE Brasil Energia recorded a nearperfect operational performance in the Gralha Azul and Novo Estado Transmission Systems, reaching overall uptime of 99.95% in 2023. The implementation of these transmission assets was concluded in February 2023.",
  "In 2023, the overall generation of the plants operated by ENGIE Brasil Energia was 43,662 GWh (4,984 average MW), 2.1% more than in 2022 - 42,778 GWh (4,883 average MW), disregarding the generation of the Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Plant, given its disposal in May 2023.\n[GRI 2-4/semicolon.case.tf G4-EU2/semicolon.case.tf SASB IF-EU-000.D]\nIn the case of hydropower plants, production in 2023 was 37,171 GWh (4,243 average MW), 1.8% higher than the previous year , a reflection of the occurrence throughout 2022 of the La Niña weather phenomenon, which persisted until the beginning of 2023. During this period, heavier rains were recorded in the North, combined with drier periods in the South of the country. From the second half of 2023 onwards, the presence of the El Niño phenomenon was established, when the predominance of rainfall was more intense in the South, favoring maximum generation at the plants in this region. As a result, due to the opposing climatic regimes in 2022 and 2023, there was an alternation of favorable hydrological periods, so that the annual average between the two years was very similar. [GRI G4-EU2/semicolon.case.tf SASB IF-EU-000.D]\nAt the complementary plants, energy production in 2023 amounted to 6,492 GWh (741 average MW), 3.6% more than the previous year . This higher production was mainly due to the start-up of the Santo Agostinho Wind Complex and the full-year accounting of the Paracatu and Floresta photovoltaic complexes, acquired in March 2022. [GRI G4-EU2/semicolon.case.tf SASB IF-EU-000.D]\nWorthy of particular note is that an increase in the Company's hydropower generation does not necessarily result in an improvement in its economic and financial performance . Likewise, a reduction in this type of generation does not necessarily imply a deterioration in economic and financial performance. This is due to the application of the Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE), which shares the hydrological risks inherent in hydropower generation between its participants.",
  "Essential for ensuring operational efficiency, the modernization of hydropower plants is an important area of investment for the Company. In 2023, the modernization projects for the Salto Osório (PR), Jaguara (SP) and Miranda (MG) hydropower plants continued. At the former, the project began in 2017 and, considered largescale, includes the replacement of equipment and systems with updated technologies - which, in addition to efficiency gains, may result in an increase in physical guarantee. In 2023, work progressed with the completion of the modernization of the third generator unit - the plan being to complete the modernization of two more units in 2024, concluding the sixth and final unit in 2025.\nThe modernization work with the installation of the new generator at Unit 1 on the Jaguara Hydropower Plant, in turn, was concluded. In addition, in 2023, the contract was signed for the general modernization of the plant's 4 generator units, which includes the other generators, turbines and supervision and control systems, and expected for completion by 2028. These measures will increase the useful life, reliability and uptime of the plant, concession of which only expires in 2048. At the Miranda Hydropower Plant, the modernization focuses on the control and instrumentation systems (including the generator's speed and voltage regulators, as well as the supervisory system). In 2023, the modernization of two generator units was completed and this upgrading process is scheduled to end in 2024 with the third and final unit.\nThe three modernization projects mentioned received R$88 million in investments in 2023 alone.",

  "A summary of the main components of the financial result is shown below, reported in detail in the Management Report and Financial Statements 2023 . [SASB IF-EU-240a.1] Net operating revenue decreased from R$11.907 billion in 2022 to R$10.748 billion in 2023 , i.e. a reduction of R$1.159 billion (9.7%). This variation mainly reflects the drop in revenue from energy sales contracts in the regulated and free contracting environments, the result of a combination of variations in the quantity of energy sold and the average net sales price, lower construction revenue - related to the transmission assets that came into operation in the year - and a lower trading volume. The average energy sales price, net of tax on revenue and trading operations, was R$226.42/MWh , 1.6% higher than the price in 2022, which was R$222.85/MWh. The increase in price between the periods under analysis was substantially due to the monetary restatement of the contracts in force, partially mitigated by the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary, which sold energy at values above the average price compared with the remainder of the Company's portfolio. The amount of energy sold in contracts, net of trading operations, reached 35,816 GWh (4,088 average MW) in 2023 , compared to 37,932 GWh (4,330 average MW) in 2022 - a decrease of 2,116 GWh (242 average MW) or 5.6%. The reduction in the amount of energy sold was due to the drop in the volume of sales to distributors, again reflecting the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary, as well as the lower volume of purchases - and consequently lower volumes available for sale. The reduction in sales volume and the increase in the average selling price led to a year-onyear reduction of R$343 million in the company's net operating revenue - R$348 million refers to the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary, which took place in the second quarter of 2023. In 2023, operational costs were R$4,841 million, R$ 1,476 million (23.4%) lower than R$6,317 million in 2022 . This variation reflects the combination of the following factors: (i) a decrease of R$ 830 million (72.8%) in the costs of the transmission segment, substantially due to the reduction in construction costs; (ii) a growth of R$409 million (9.1%) in the energy generation and sales portfolio; (iii) a reduction of R$234 million (35.0%) in the costs of energy trading operations; and (iv)  a variation of R$3 million in the costs of the sale and installation of solar panels following the sale of ENGIE Geração Solar Distribuída.",
  "Between 2022 and 2023, adjusted EBITDA increased by R$329 million (4.7%), from R$6.941 billion to R$7.270 billion . The variation was the result of the combination of the following positive effects: (i) R$266 million (36.6%) resulting from a higher result from the equity interest in a jointly controlled company - TAG; and (ii) R$185 million (32.3%) from the energy transmission segment.

The revision of the Materiality (Impact) Study was based on the relevant themes listed in 2022 following an extensive process of engagement with local communities through the Sustainability Panels - a face-toface multi-stakeholder event dedicated to identifying socio-environmental aspects and impacts resulting from ENGIE Brasil Energia's activities. In addition to employees of the plants, community leaders, educators, local suppliers, and representatives of third sector entities and public bodies were invited to indicate the positive and negative impacts of the Company's presence in each territory, as well as its potential contribution to sustainable development. [GRI 2-29; 3-1; 413-2]\nthe scope of the listening process. The process was coordinated by a specialized consultancy - to ensure impartiality and balance in the collection of opinions. [GRI 2-29; 3-1; 413-2]\nHeld between August and November 2022, the panels involved communities located in the sphere of influence  of eight hydropower plants operated by the Company, as well as its headquarters, bringing together about 430 people. In parallel to the panels, individual interviews were held with other members of these communities - especially government  sector managers - to broaden\nIn accordance with GRI guidelines, the extent of impact on stakeholders was the parameter for the degree of engagement of other audiences in addition to communities, employees and local suppliers making up the representative sample present on the panels. ENGIE Brasil Energia therefore prioritized consultation with two other social groups potentially affected by its activities: investors and customers. The former were invited to answer a questionnaire on the relevance of the issues identified as potentially material by ENGIE Brasil Energia. This questionnaire was posed at the \"Inside ENGIE\" event, held on December 7, 2022. A total of 16 investors took part in the consultation. Likewise, a sample of 185 of the Company's customers was invited to respond online to the same questionnaire as was presented to investors. Of this total, five effectively took part. [GRI 2-29; 3-1] Based on the definition of material issues, the performance indicators to be monitored and reported by the Company were selected. In this cycle, in addition to the disclosures proposed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and traditionally reported, indicators from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) - CDSB Framework and Electric Utilities Power Generators Standard (2018) were added where applicable. On the following pages, the GRI Summary indicates the location of the responses to the indicators throughout - and, in some cases, the Summary itself presents the response to the indicator.

  "Dear Shareholders,\nThe Management of ENGIE Brasil Energia S.A. ('ENGIE Brasil Energia' or 'Company') is pleased to submit for your appreciation the Management Report and the corresponding Financial Statements for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 , in accordance with international practices and those adopted in Brazil. The Management Report is accompanied by the reports of the Independent Auditors, Fiscal Council and Audit Committee for the year ending 12.31.2024 The data shown in the Management Report is stated in millions of Reais and on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise stated.\nThis document complies with the requirements of Law 6,404/76, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission\n(CVM)  regulations  and  the  Accounting  Manual  of  the National  Electric  Energy  Agency  (Aneel).  Even  though the Report  is directed primarily at the Company's shareholders,  it  can  be  accessed  by  the  public  on  the websites of ENGIE Brasil Energia, CVM and B3 (B3 S.A. -  Brasil,  Bolsa,  Balcão).  In  compliance  with  Brazilian legislation, it is also published in the press of the state in which the Company's  head offices  are  located  -  Santa Catarina.\nComplementary  to  the  information  published  in  this document,  the  Company  also  publishes,  in  April,  its Sustainability Report, with a more comprehensive content,  according  to  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative (GRI)  and  Sustainability  Accounting  Standards  Board (SASB) frameworks.",
  "Financial discipline,  operational  efficiency,  commercial  intelligence  and  above  all,  absolute  respect  for people and the planet. Anchored to these principles, we close the challenging year of 2024 not only by demonstrating  resilience  in  our  operational  and  financial  result  but  also  commemorating  important achievements.\nThe entry into operation of projects under implementation and acquisition of already operating renewable energy assets, more than compensated for the divestments of 2023, resulting in a year-on-year increase of 4.4% in Net Operating Revenue, posting R$ 11,219 million in 2024. Adjusted Ebitda was R$ 7,367 million, 1.3% over the amount reported for the previous year, considering the reduction in equity income due to the partial sale of the stake in the jointly controlled subsidiary - TAG. Adjusted Net Income closed the year at R$ 3,372 million, 1.4% lower than the total recorded in 2023, impacted by the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to the new plants joining our portfolio.\nThe expansion in our operations resulted in some important milestones during the year: by the end of 2024, 1.2 GW had been added to proprietary installed capacity which now totals 9.6 GW of 100% renewable energy , distributed from 115 plants. In addition to the Santo Agostinho Wind Complex in full operation and the acquisition of five photovoltaic assets, all of them operational as well, we anticipated the startup at the Serra do Assuruá Wind Complex, operating commercially at more than half its total installed  capacity  of  846  MW.  In  parallel,  we  began  operational  testing  at  the  Assú  Sol  Photovoltaic Complex, this to add a further 752 MW to capacity of our generator park over the course of 2025.\nWe also continue to grow the transmission segment, making a successful bid for the main lot of the National Electric Energy Agency's second auction round in 2024 and denominated Graúna Transmissora de Energia , which is to reinforce the country's South and Southeast/Central -West subsystems. With an extension of 780 kilometers, this will be the fifth transmission project to be implemented, adding to the 2,710 kilometers of power lines already in operation and the 1,000 kilometers of the Asa Branca project, where work is in progress.\nThe year of 2024 also stands out as the one when the most investments were made in the history of ENGIE Brasil Energia, approximately R$ 9.7 billion, the larger part of it in wind and photovoltaic plants. And we now have a further R$ 8.5 billion of investment already committed for the 2025 to 2027 period.\nIn  2024,  we  recorded  a 32%  increase  in  the  number  of  contracts  signed  in  the  Free  Energy  Market, demonstrating  the  success  of  our  commercial  strategy  -  from  end-to-end  digitalization  to  marketing actions - to serve this increasingly diversified and complex segment.\nWe dedicate the same care to people as we do to the business. A reflection of this was ENGIE Brasil Energia's inclusion in the list of the best companies to work for in Brazil, according to the Great Place to Work ranking . We are certain that this recognition reflects the affection we hold for each and every one of those who dedicate their knowledge and, most importantly, a large part of their time, to achieving our goals.\nAn  open  dialog  and  actions  guided  by  the  collective  interest  have  marked  our  relationship  with  the communities of which we are a part: in 2024 alone, we invested between proprietary and tax incentive resources, R$  48.7  million  in  initiatives  with  a  social  impact,  a  historical  record  for  us .  One  of  the outstanding events in this context was the rollout of our sixth Culture and Sustainability Center in Trairi (CE).\nWe would also highlight the intensification of our climate mitigation and adaptation agenda. An example of  this  is  our  Supplier  Decarbonization  Program  which  includes  diagnosis,  training,  and  access  to opportunities for transition to a low carbon economy along our value chain. The Program was presented with the UNO Global Compact Award - Network Brazil in the 'Climate Guardians' category during the United Nations Organization's 29th Climate Conference (COP 29) .",
  "Finally, it was with great pleasure that we were notified of ENGIE Brasil Energia's inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index 2024 ,  and being listed in the Sustainability Yearbook by S&P  Global,  among  the  six  best-assessed  names  in  the  electric  power  sector -confirming  both  our commitment and the effectiveness of our environmental, social and governance practices.\nWe invite you to join us in building this future, driven by hope, inspiring companies and people. At ENGIE Brasil Energia, we will remain obstinate in overcoming challenges, attentive to growth opportunities and focused on sustainable development -our sole interest.\nGood reading!\nMauricio Stolle Bähr Chairman of the Board of Director\nEduardo Antonio Gori Sattamini Chief Executive Officer For the first time, ENGIE  Brasil Energia has become  a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index , ranking among the six best performances in the electric utilities sector.\nObtains GPTW Great Place To Work Brasil certification which recognizes the best companies in which to work.\nPlaced  21 st in the  ' Global  100 ' ranking which lists the 100 most sustainable companies in the world ,  promoted by the Canadian publisher Corporate Knights.\nGuardians for the Climate accolade awarded  by  the  UNO  Global  Compact  Brasil Network for the 'Suppliers Decarbonization Program.\nComponent of the 2024/2025 portfolios of B3's Carbon  Efficient (ICO2), Diversity (IDIVERSA), Corporate Governance - Novo Mercado (IGC-NM), Dividends (IDIV) indices.\nWinner of the Energy category and highlight in  Exame  magazine's Best  of  ESG for  the third consecutive year.\nHighlight  of  the  energy  sector  in  Exame magazine's Best and Biggest 2024 .\nHighlight in the Transparency Trophy 2024 , sponsored by the National Association of Finance, Administration and Accounting  Executives  (Anefac)  -  in  the 'Companies with net revenue from R$ 5 to R$ 20 billion' category.\n6 th place in the Broadcast Empresas award which recognizes the companies which has given the best return to the investors.\nFeatures in all categories of the Institutional  Investor magazine's  ranking ( Electric & Other Utilities - Latin America).\n(1) ROE: net income over the last four quarters /shareholders equity.",

  "Since  2023,  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  occupies  the  position  as  the  largest  electric  energy  generator  from  100% renewable sources in Brazil.  At the end of 2024, the Company's generation assets encompassed 115 plants: 11 hydropower plants and 104 plants  powered from complementary sources (wind, solar, SHPs and biomass plants). Together, these amount to an installed capacity of 11,265.5 MW, of which 9,555.7 MW are proprietary capacity , given that 111 plants are wholly owned by the Company - only in the case of the Itá, Machadinho and Estreito hydropower plants and the Ibitiúva Bioenergética Co-generation Plant  is ownership shared.\nIn 2024, the Santo Agostinho Wind Complex - Phase 1, in Rio Grande do Norte, with an installed capacity of 434 MW, became fully operational. The project involved resources of the order of R$ 2.3 billion and generated more than a thousand direct jobs in the region of the municipalities of Lajes and Pedro Avelino, some 120 kilometers from the state capital Natal.\nAlso in 2024, ENGIE Brasil Energia acquired all the shares held by Atlas Energia Renovável do Brasil S.A. and Atlas Brasil Energia Holding 2 S.A., for the acquisition of the Juazeiro, São Pedro, Sol do Futuro, Sertão Solar and Lar do Sol photovoltaic plants, located in the states of Bahia, Ceará and Minas Gerais, an investment of approximately R$ 3.2 billion. The installed capacity of the assets, all fully operational, is 545 MWac, which corresponds to 661 MWp, while the commercial capacity is 145.1 average MW. The acquisition is in line with the Company's growth strategy, despite the energy oversupply prevailing in 2024, bearing in mind that the assets are highly contracted in the long term, mostly in the regulated environment.\nConversely, in May 2024, the Company sold the Lages Cogeneration Plant (28MW), which was nearing the end of its cycle of economic and financial viability, in line with our policy of  financial discipline.",
  "ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  investments/divestment  decisions  are  supported  by  rigorous  feasibility  analyses,  which include impacts, risks and opportunities related to sustainability. In addition to assessing economic, operational and socio-environmental aspects, the Company considers scenarios from a strategic market and business perspective. Based on these premises, it has ensured sustainable growth, supported by the expansion of generation and the secure and consistent operation of its assets. Jirau  Energia  S.A.  is  responsible  for  the  maintenance,  operation  and  sale  of  energy  generated  by  the  Jirau Hydropower Plant, located on the Madeira River, Porto Velho (RO).

Comprising 24 wind farms being installed in a single phase in the municipality of Gentio do Ouro, state of Bahia, the project's authorization grant has been issued by Aneel, the Complex to have an estimated installed capacity of 846 MW and estimated commercial capacity of 410.2 average MW .  With  the  creation  of  around  3,000  direct  and indirect jobs in the region, the estimated investment is approximately R$ 6 billion (as of May/2022).\nBy the end of 2024, 97% of the work on the project had been completed. The activities involving the assembly and commissioning of the wind turbines are being executed with the schedule for completion of this work expected to be anticipated, more than 95% of the wind turbines having been assembled/erected and 76% of them commissioned. The substation, transmission line and connection bay are already completely energized. Civil engineering work has been completed and medium voltage networks are in the final stages of completion.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 109 wind turbines were in commercial operations while a further 55 were operating on a  test  basis  -  the  project  has  188  in  total.  By  February  20,  2025,  30  more  generator  units  were  operating commercially and 46 were on a test basis, adding an eventual 832.5 MW of capacity to the portfolio. The projected completion of the implementation has been moved up to the first half of 2025.",
  "The project is located in the municipality of Assú, state of Rio Grande do Norte and is to have an installed capacity of approximately 752 MWac (895 MWp) and an estimated commercial capacity of 229.6 average MW -  at  an investment worth approximately R$ 3.3 billion (as of Jan/23).\nImplementation activities had advanced to 76% completion by the end of 2024 Activities for connection to the system and  brush  clearance  have  been  completed  while  engineering,  earth  moving,  drainage,  foundation  work, tracker assembly, solar panel installation and commissioning activities continue to be executed.\nThe entry into operation on a test basis of the first photovoltaic units took place in October 2024. By the end of the year, five of the 16 solar farms were operating on a test basis. As of February 20, 2025, four farms were operating commercially and a further three on a test basis, contributing 302.7 MW to the Company's portfolio. The entry into full commercial operations is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025. At  the  end  of  2024,  a  series  of  projects    involving  photovoltaic  plants  and  wind  complexes  were  undergoing feasibility studies. If implemented, these projects could generate approximately a further 1.7 GW for ENGIE Brasil Energia's generator park.\nSome  of  these  projects  under  study  are  located  in  the  vicinity  of  other  of  the  Company's  operational  assets permitting the capture of synergies in terms of both resources and infrastructure and optimizing implementation the  case,  for  example,  of  the  Santo  Agostinho  Photovoltaic  Complex,  under  analysis  for  installation    in  an  area contiguous  to the Wind Complex of the same name in the state of Rio Grande do Norte.\nIn addition, the Company constantly assesses opportunities for acquiring working enterprises, given current market conditions.",
  "ENGIE Brasil Energia operates in the Regulated Contracting Environment (ACR), attending an expected demand in auctions organized by Aneel, and in the Free Contracting Environment (ACL), commercializing directly with final consumers. At the end of 2024, the Company enjoyed a share of 7.5% in the free market reporting growth of 31.7% in the number of free consumers served . Among other factors, the Company's good results in  this segment are a reflection of the opening of this market to all high voltage consumers since January following the issue of Ministry of Mines and Energy's Normative Ordinance 50/2022. This liberalization opened up the Free Energy Market to more than 100 thousand new potential consumers.\nFree consumers (with the exception of CCEE and other revenues) represented 40.0% of physical sales and 35.3% of net operating revenue, amounts 1.4 p.p. and 1.9 p.p. lower when compared to 2023.The variation is due mainly to the change in commercialization class of some existing customers in the Company's portfolio from Free Consumer to Trading Companies, given existing advantages for the latter economic group.\nIn addition to the benefit of an accumulated experience of more than 20 years of ACL operations since the inception of this business segment, ENGIE Brasil Energia has been for several years now, preparing for the gradual opening of the free market to other consumer profiles. It has thus been able to develop appropriate solutions for different audiences and take full advantage of the opportunities arising from this market opening.\nThe Company's expectations are for still more expansion with the growth in ACL attracting a larger audience as well as stimulating the migration of other consumers. ACL business accounted for 43.1% of domestic electric energy consumption at the end of 2024, with a growth of 10.6% in consumption and 55.7% in the number of consumers , in comparison with 2023. Additionally, a bill in discussion before Congress proposes the opening by mid-2028 to all low  voltage  consumers.  Should  this  become  a  reality,  it  would  represent  a  potential  market  of  80  million  free consumers.\nThe results reported by the Company in the ACL segment are also a reflection of the adopted commercialization strategy which has among its guidelines the gradual sale of energy avaialble for future delivery, thus mitigating the exposure to short-term energy prices (Price for Settlement of Differences - PLD or spot price) and protection against negative market scenarios. In addition, there is a combination of portfolio management and commercial dynamism through  the  medium  of  digital  platforms  and  prospection  channels  which  potentializes  the  ability  to  leverage windows of opportunity for the purchase and sale of energy.\nAgain,  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  has  in  its  favor  the  robustness  and  diversification  of  assets  in  its  generator  park, guaranteeing  security  of  supply,  supported  by  the  execution  of  long-term  agreements.  This  advantage  also contributes  to  the  construction  of  market  reputation  and  credibility  which  naturally  favors  the  attraction  and retention of customers.\nStill within the scope of its commercialization strategy, innovation and digitalization carry an important weighting in the development of solutions and  products in line with new tendencies and necessities in the market. In developing solutions which simplify the  process of migration to the free market and facilitate the digital journey in energy purchaing  transactions,  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  renders  migration  more  attractive  and  stimulates,  directly  and indirectly, the expansion of this market in Brazil.",
  "The  Company's  operations  in  the  transmission  segment  are  progressing  consistently,  with  financial  discipline, guaranteeing  complementarity  to  the  business  fronts,  and  operational  robustness  for  delivery  of  the  energy generated to the National Interconnected System. At the end of the year, the Company operated more than 2,700 kilometers of transmission lines and seven associated substations in different regions of the country . In 2024, it completed the full energization of the Gavião Real transmission system in Pará, operated in integration with the Novo Estado System in Tocantins. ENGIE Brasil Energia also operates the Gralha Azul transmission system in Paraná.\nAlso notable was the successful bid for Lot 1 in Auction 2/2024, for the implementation of the Graúna Transmission System.  The  project  has  780  kilometers  of  transmission  line,  including  six  new  lines,  two  substations  and  new sectionalizing, as well as the operation of other existing lines and substations. It is worth noting that the project has locational synergies with the Gralha Azul Transmission System, including the sectionalizing of the transmission line, and with other company assets.\nIn all, the new system will cross 47 municipalities in the states of Santa Catarina, Paraná, Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Espírito Santo. The concession period is 30 years.",
  "Expansion in transmission systems takes place through auctions organized by the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), which is responsible for defining the lots and the maximum amounts of the Annual Permitted Revenue (RAP) for each project. Thus, the predictability of growth in this segment is based on technical-financial studies of each project to be auctioned, risk appetite and growth capacity. Acquired in the Transmission Auction 01/2023, promoted by Aneel, Lot 5 was denominated Asa Branca and will have around 1,000 kilometers of extension . Located in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, the project provides for the implementation of four 500 kV single-circuit transmission lines. The concession period for the public transmission service, including licensing, construction, operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities, will be 30 years from the date of execution of the concession contract, which occurred in September, 2023.\nBy the end of 2024, work on the Morro do Chapéu II - Poções III stretch continued in progress with the activities of earth movement and civil works at the substations together with brush clearance, civil works and assembly of metallic structures relative to the transmission line. During October, delivery of the conductor cables in the field also began. The maximum deadline for starting operations is March 2029, with anticipation of at least 24 months. At the beginning of 2024, ENGIE Brasil Energia concluded the partial sale of 15% stake in TAG, its participation in the latter declining from 32.5% to 17.5%. However, the ENGIE Group as a whole continued to retain a 50% stake in the  capital  stock  of  the  company.  The  largest  transmitter  of natural  gas  in  Brazil, TAG  has  an  infrastructure  of  more  than 4,500 km of high-pressure gas  pipelines,  crossing  10  Brazilian states and approximately 200 municipalities .  The infrastructure extends  along  the  country's  southeastern  and  northeastern seaboards as well as a further section of line between Urucu and Manaus, in the state of Amazonas",

This paid by the  direct  controller  of  the  Company,  ENGIE  Brasil  Participações  Ltda.  at  the  end  of  the  three  year mandate.\n· Benefits  package  for  guaranteeing  the  social  and  health  conditions  required  by  the  position  occupied, including health insurance, preventive  and health recovery programs, annual check-up, food vouchers, life insurance and complementary pension.\nAs with the remuneration of directors, the annual amount allocated to the remuneration of the Executive Board is approved by the General Meeting. Variable remuneration is calculated using the same methodology as the ENGIE Group:\n· 65% linked to financial objectives (EBIT, Free Cash Flow and General  and Administrative Expenses);\n· 25% linked to individual management targets;\n· 10% linked to ESG targets (non financial), two themes having equal weighting - Ocupational Health and Safety (SST) and gender diversity in the labor force.\nThe methodology also incoporates penalties of up to 20% in cases of:\n· Significant decline in  the results of Occupational Health and Safety;\n· Non-Compliance with values related to ethics and conformity; and\n· Inadequate managerial behavior.\nPerformance and the meeting of targets and indicators are measured through a formal assessment done annually. The CEO assesses the other seven officers and he, in turn, is evaluated by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The results of these assessments are discussed and approved by the Directors. ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  governance  is  also  underpinned  by  its  policies  and  codes  of  conduct,  approved  by  the Executive Board and the Board of Directors. Applicable to the entire organizational structure of the  Company, including subsidiaries, these documents list values and guidelines that ensure integrity and transparency in business and relations with different stakeholders. They also contribute to the legal compliance of activities and the fulfillment of standards and commitments in different areas, such as human rights, environmental protection, competition, data protection and tackling corruption.\nThe guidelines established are mandatory for all those acting on behalf of ENGIE Brasil Energia. Published on the Company's website, these documents are periodically reviewed so that they remain in line with best market practices and  ENGIE's  purposes  and  values.  In  2024,  the  following  documents  were  revised  and  made  available  in  their updated versions:",
  "· Policy  for  Remuneration  of  Directors,  Officers  and  Committee  Members (February) and  Policy  for Nomination of Directors, Officers and Committee Members (June): both policies are aimed at integrity and the  continuous  improvement  of  governance,  based  on  transparent  guidelines  and  procedures  for  the composition  of  senior  management  and  remuneration  for  services  rendered.

The Charter of the Board of Directors, together with the Policy on the  Nomination of Members, have improved governance with rules to avoid overboarding and ensuring minimum attendance at meetings and diversity in the composition of the Board. The revision also promoted the implementation of a continuous updating program for board members (learn more in Organizational Structure).\n· Sustainable Management Policy (June): expressly declares ENGIE Brasil Energia's support for the UN Global Compact, the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals, the guiding principles of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Paris Agreement. It establishes principles for Ocupational Health and Safety at work, quality, governance, social responsibility, stakeholder engagement, respect for the environment and, asset management as a topic to be included in the revised version in 2024,.\n· Code of Ethical Conduct (July): reflects the Company's commitment to integrity, responsibility, honesty and transparency and repudiates all forms of corruption and fraud, as well as any violations of human rights, laws and regulations in force, including ENGIE Brasil Energia's policies (see below).

  "ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  organizational  structure  includes  a  Governance,  Risks  and  Controls  Department,  which fosters the integration of processes, based on a systemic vision of the business. As a result, it is able to achieve more efficient levels of management, with close supervision of all the sensitive aspects of its activities.\nAnother measure aimed at making governance more efficient is the maintenance of the Integrated Management System  (IMS),  which  covers  the  NBR  ISO  9001  -  Quality  Management,  NBR  ISO  14001  -  Environmental Management and NBR ISO 45001 - Occupational Health and Safety Management standards. In 2024, the Company completed 20 years of certification under these standards and has ensured continued certification, without nonconformities, for 11 of its assets, in addition to the corporate headquarters - corresponding to 72.0% of the installed capacity operated in the generation segment, and 85.3% of employees.\nOperational procedures, compliance with legal requirements, performance indicators, among other relevant aspects, were checked to demonstrate compliance of the processes with the requirements of the three standards, as well as applicable legislation and ENGIE's own policies. Certification is conducted by an independent body, hired on the basis of isonomic criteria, ensuring impartiality and reliability - essential to this process.\nThe Company's other operating units, although not certified, also adhere to procedures implemented under the Integrated Management System. This adherence is important, since the system facilitates the standardization of documents  and  routines  and  encourages  greater  employee  awareness  of  issues  related  to  health,  safety,  the environment and continuous improvement.",
  "An  inseparable  component  of  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  culture  is  the  ethical  guide  to  business  management, governance  and  professional  practices,  both  collective  and  individual.  The  Company  adopts  clear  guidelines  to ensure respect for Human Rights in all its operations and activities and expressly declares zero tolerance of any form of corruption and child, forced or compulsory labor.\nThe ethical and integrity principles assumed permeate relations with all stakeholders and are presented in various institutional policies, especially the Code of Ethical Conduct. These documents are also aligned with the standards and commitments established in international pacts and declarations, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\nTo  ensure  compliance  with  these  commitments  and  the  continuous  improvement  of  compliance,  ENGIE  Brasil Energia relies on the work of the Ethics Committee, a governance body reporting directly to the Board of Directors. In addition to overseeing the issue and managing questions related to ethics and integrity, the Committee establishes action plans to mitigate ethical risks, involving aspects such as ensuring decent working conditions throughout the value chain and respecting the rights of local communities and traditional populations in the regions where the assets are located.\nWith regard to the risk of corruption or fraud, risks of bribery, fraudulent use of property, interference in competitive processes, among other forms of transgression, are monitored and managed. The Company also adheres to voluntary commitments, such as the United Nations Global Compact, the Business Pact for Integrity and Against Corruption, the  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI)  and  the  French  section  of  the  NGO  Transparency International. · Code of Ethical Conduct\n· Guide to Ethical Practices\n· Prevention of Corruption and Bribery  Policy\n· Human Rights Policy\n· Prevention of Conflicts of Interests Policy\n· Privacy and Protection of Personal Data\n· Counterparty Due Diligence Policies\n· Embargo Policy\n· Relationship with Government Agents Policy\n· Code of Conduct in Relations with Suppliers\n· Procedures in relation to Gifts and Hospitality",
  "· Ethos Institute: ENGIE Brasil Energia has joined the Ethos Institute for Business and Social Responsibility, an OSCIP (Civil Society of Public Interest) that seeks to mobilize, sensitize and support companies so that they manage their businesses responsibly and contribute to building a fair and ethical society. As well as keeping  the  Company  connected  to  good  market  practices,  the  association  is  a  way  of  broadening  its participation in discussions on public policies aimed at promoting integrity. It is worth remembering that, at the  end  of  2023,  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  obtained  the  Pro-Ethics  Seal,  awarded  by  the  Office  of  the Comptroller General (CGU), in partnership with the Ethos Institute, to companies that adopt good practices of ethics, transparency and integrity in the management of their businesses.\n· MPSC Partnership : the Company signed a partnership with the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Santa Catarina to support the program 'Educating Citizens: what have you got to do with corruption'. The initiative brings together public and private partners to create a new culture of social control, by training active and aware citizens to act preventively and strategically in tackling corruption.\n· Actions for raising awareness : events were held to raise awareness among employees and partners about the importance of ethics in work activities and routines. One of the initiatives promoted more than ten meetings to share good practices with suppliers of the Company's assets. On the other hand, employees from both the Head Office and the assets took part in 'Conversation Rounds', with the participation of managers and members of the Ethics Committee, who reinforced how the Ethics Channel works, provided clarification of doubts and reiterated the aspects of confidentiality and non-retaliation for users. As part of the Internal Week for the Prevention of Occupational Accidents - SIPAT, a lecture was given by a renowned professor and philosopher on the importance of ethics in day-to-day activities and combating all forms of harassment. New employees, in turn, took part in ethics onboarding. Some specific topics were also the subject of orientation campaigns, such as the rules on gifts and hospitality and electoral rules in the light of the period of the municipal elections .",
  "The roles assigned to ENGIE Brasil Energia's governance bodies and control and management dynamics ensure that compliance is internalized in all of the Company's processes, areas and hierarchical levels. The Ethics Committee plays a central role in ensuring compliance with established individual and collective values and the application of the relevant policies and codes.\nThe Ethics Committee is also responsible for dissemination, raising awareness and sensitization as to standards of ethics  and  integrity  as  well  as  identifying,  preventing,  mitigating  and  managing  ethical  risks.  It  also  investigates reports  of  violations  and  proposes  disciplinary  measures,  when  appropriate,  and  establishing  an  Investigatory Commission for this purpose.\nAnd as a way of making ethical compliance more robust and reliable, the Ethics Committee reports quarterly to the Board of Directors on its activities and relevant facts, including ethical incidents and the treatment given to each case. These reports are shared with the ENGIE Brasil Participações' Ethics and Compliance Officer, the Statutory Audit Committee and controlling entities.\nAnother relevant compliance tool is the INCOME Program, set up by ENGIE Brasil  Energia in 2006 to improve internal controls and risk management. It provides for an annual self-assessment of the Company's main processes and controls,  as  well  as  the  testing  of  a  sample  of  processes  and  controls  by  an  independent  third  party.  Any deviations identified are addressed with specific action plans and all results are communicated to the Executive Board, the Statutory Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\nFinally, periodic assessments of suppliers reinforce compliance mechanisms, extending this care to the entire value chain. Evaluations are planned for new partners and also for those who are already active suppliers. Leading suppliers to the Company are also subject to more meticulous control measures (find out more in Chapter 2, under Value Chain).",
  "More than just making ethics a fundamental pillar of its culture, ENGIE Brasil Energia believes it is important to provide the appropriate means for recording and dealing with episodes that may characterize a breach of shared values and principles. In this context, it provides the public with the Ethics Channel, which is open to anyone who wishes to report inappropriate situations such as harassment, conflict of interest, corruption, discrimination, fraud, breach of confidentiality, violation of laws or institutional policies and any other inappropriate conduct.\nThe Company encourages the use of the channel, publicising its existence to internal and external audiences and encouraging employees and partners to report any deviations observed along the entire  value chain. Complaints can be made via a website or a free phone line, which is manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Whistleblowers are guaranteed anonymity, security and non-retaliation.\nThe Channel is managed by an independent external company, rendering the process more reliable. It is this company that registers the complaints and performs a preliminary analysis of their content. Only then does it forward the records to ENGIE Brasil Energia's Ethics Committee for initial analysis of admissibility and treatment, as provided for in the Internal Procedure for Handling Allegations.\nAfter the analysis and treatment of the case, the Ethics Committee forwards the appropriate recommendations to the responsible manager in accordance with internal standards and legal aspects. If a violation is proven, there may also be disciplinary measures, ranging from a warning to dismissal, depending on the seriousness of the case. For contractors,  there  may  be  contractual  sanctions  or  immediate  suspension  of  the  contract,  without  loss  of  legal measures that may be necessary.\nThe whistleblower is regularly informed of the progress and results achieved. Information relating to the complaint, such as the record of the initial communication, investigation report and minutes of the Ethics Committee, is stored, guaranteeing confidentiality and data protection.",
  "Ethical conduct with integrity also involves respect for the privacy of others and, consequently, the protection of personal  data.  ENGIE Brasil  Energia  is  committed  to  guaranteeing  data  security  and  protection,  a  responsibility expressed in its institutional policies. The documents are available for consultation on the Company's website and comply with the General Data Protection Law, ENGIE's Code of Ethical Conduct and risk management and asset protection mechanisms.\nThe Data  Security  Policy  brings  together  the  general  principles  of  asset  protection  and  the  guidelines  for  risk management and  handling incidents. The Privacy and Personal Data Protection Policy establishes the premises to be followed when collecting and processing data, without deviating from the purpose. It also determines compliance with the data subject's notification and requirements of prior consent, as well as the responsibility and accountability inherent in the handling of information.\nBoth  policies  are  approved  by  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  Executive  Committee.  The  Data  Security  and  Privacy Committee is responsible for keeping them up to date and disclosed, supervising compliance, carrying out training and raising awareness and maintaining an active Personal Data Protection Program. In 2024, the Company recorded no cases of breach, including customer data.\nIn addition, ENGIE Brasil Energia adopts strict access and operating control mechanisms in its infrastructure and uses state-of-the-art technology to protect networks and devices. Security processes are assessed in internal and external audits performed for anticipating possible vulnerabilities and planning the corresponding measures for their treatment.",
  "A  fundamental  pillar  of  governance,  risk  and  opportunity  management  is  seen  by  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  as  an indispensable means of ensuring the continuity of its business and the achievement of consistent and sustainable results. This is the means the Company uses to remain competitive and resilient in adverse scenarios and able to capture good projects and make assertive decisions for continued growth and the creation of value.\nThe procedures adopted are guided by the Corporate Risks and Opportunities Management Policy and take into account the guidelines of the French Duty of Vigilance law ( Devoir de Vigilance ) applied to the ENGIE Group. There are  also  bodies  dedicated  to  the  subject,  such  as  the  Governance,  Risks  and  Controls  Department,  which  is responsible for promoting the transversal management of risks and opportunities, based on a systemic vision of the business, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Statutory Audit Committee and the Risk Management Forum also provide support for management. Risk management is therefore an activity that involves the entire Company on a shared and permanent basis. One of the important tools supporting governance is the Corporate Risks and Opportunities Matrix. The document identifies  and  classifies  business  risks  in  terms  of  the  likelihood  of  occurrence  and  the  relevance  of  possible reputational, financial, strategic and operational damage. It also serves as a basis for drawing up prevention and mitigation plans and guides the Annual Internal Audit Plan for continuous improvement of management.\nThe Matrix is drawn up annually by the Governance, Risks and Controls Unit, with the direct participation and approval of the Executive Board, and also validated by the Board of Directors. The document is prepared using risk analysis performed in accordance with the methodology adopted by the ENGIE Group, based on ISO 31000 and COSO ERM. In addition to identifying new risks in interviews with directors and managers, the residual risks, which remain after the implementation of mitigation plans, and the inherent risks, which existed before these plans, are cvonsidered.\nIn 2024, the cycle resulted in the consolidation of 11 main  groups  of  risk  on  the  basis  of  which  57 mitigatory plans are prepared and monitored quarterly. Complementary to this, the risk management process is also incorported within the scope  of the annual audits, both  internal and external, based on  the ISO standards (9001, 14001 45001) certification.",

For ENGIE Brasil Energia, innovative solutions are fundamental to building alternatives to the challenges faced by society, especially with regard to climate change. As such, the Company's activities in the area of innovation are mainly  focused  on energy  resources,  renewable  sources,  energy  efficiency,  automation  and  digitalization  of processes, as well as the mitigation of socio-environmental impacts.\nIn  this  respect,  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  encourages  initiatives  that  have  a  positive  impact  on  society  and  fosters collaboration, both internally and through external partnerships, combining science, technology and human capital. ENGIE Brasil Energia's network of partners includes companies of all sizes, entrepreneurs, students, researchers, universities and other institutions, which join forces with the Company to create solutions to today's challenges.",
  "Aneel's  PDI  Program  is  one  of  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  most  important  mechanisms  for  fostering  innovation, supporting its commitment to boosting science and technology in Brazil, in line with the interests of the sector and sustainable development. According to Law 9,991/2000, companies in the electric energy sector must allocate 1% of their annual net operating revenue to Research, Development and Innovation activities.\nHistorically, ENGIE Brasil Energia has invested more than R$ 250 million in around 228 projects, involving different partners. In 2024, more than R$ 55.0 million was earmarked for the Program , distributed as follows:\n- R$ 22.0 milion to the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FNDCT);\n- R$ 11.0 million to the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) to fund the Energy Research Company (EPE);\n- R$ 6.6 million to the Energy Development account (CDE) to cover low tariffs;\n- R$ 15.4 million to be invested in R&D projects by the Company.\nVolume invested by ENGIE Brasil Energia in 17 ongoing projects in 2024, using the balance of resources available for investments in Aneel's PDI was R$ 18.1 million, distributed among the areas of activity shown in the following chart. One of the major highlights in 2024 of the Aneel PDI was the publication in October of the results of the 'PDI Climate Change', a call for proposals from ENGIE Brasil Energia which included eight projects to be financed by the Company , all with a climate change theme. The investment amounted to more than R$ 4 million over two years .\nOut  of  more  than  50  proposals,  eight  were  selected  based  on  criteria  such  as  originality  and  uniqueness,  the respective project research and development activities being performed from January 2022 to August 2024 and mobilizing universities, startups, companies and Scientific, Technological and Innovation Institutions, which broadens and strengthens the relationship between academia, the scientific community and private enterprise.\nThe projects studied operational tools to increase the efficiency of long-term climate forecasting and the impacts of climate change and land use on the Brazilian electricity sector to support decision-making in energy planning and optimize the tackling and prevention of extreme events and adverse scenarios. Innovation  is  also  encouraged  internally  at  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  through  intrapreneurship.  The  Inove  Program, maintained by the Company, encourages innovative suggestions from all employees, from all areas and hierarchical levels. The focus is on ideas aimed at operational efficiency, improving internal processes and creating products and services  in  line  with  the  Company's  objectives,  including  ESG  aspects.  Approved  ideas  receive  resources  for implementation and their authors are recognized and rewarded once completed.\nIn 2024, the Program registered a record number of entries: more than 400 initiatives were registered by employees, compared to 137 in 2023. One  of  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  initiatives  within  the  Open  Innovation  model  is  the  Company's  participation  in LinkLab, a program run by the Catarinense Technology Association (Acate), which fosters the connection between large and small companies to facilitate the implementation of projects and the contracting of services and solutions from the startup ecosystem in Brazil. This connection also is instrumental in the development of Proofs of Concept (PQC) which, if validated, result in applicable business solutions. If there is a specific challenge to be tackled, ENGIE Brasil Energia also adopts the practice of democratically opening calls for projects so that different proponents can suggest solutions. The processes for training and engaging teams at ENGIE Brasil Energia seek, first  and  foremost,  to  promote  a  safe,  respectful,  diverse,  inclusive  and innovative work environment. The Company fosters relationships based on trust,  transparency  and  honesty  and  gives  employees  the  opportunity  to realize their full potential. This is a commitment in ENGIE Brasil Energia's social impact agenda and it is also in this way that the Company believes it is possible to achieve consistent business growth in line with its established purposes, especially those related to ESG.\nAt the end of 2024, ENGIE Brasil Energia had a headcount of 1,173 direct employees, an increase of 6.7% compared to 2023 , due to the acquisition of  five  photovoltaic  complexes  and  the  start  of  work  on  the  Asa  Branca\nTransmission System. The workforce also included 100 trainees, two apprentices and a further 347 employees linked to companies that are not fully controlled - TAG (312), Companhia Energética Estreito (31) and Itá Energética (4). In addition, during the year another 7,118 on average, regularly provided services at ENGIE Brasil Energia's facilities or projects - the vast majority of them linked to projects under construction.",
  "A fair remuneration policy, together with a package of benefits that provide better health conditions and quality of life, is one of the most important elements in attracting and engaging manpower. ENGIE Brasil Energia's practice is to  remunerate  its  employees  with  fixed  and  variable  installments,  making  up  a  total  amount  that  is  fair  and competitive in the market.\nThe variable installment corresponds to Profit and/or Results Sharing, negotiated annually with the labor unions and paid to all employees as an incentive to achieve corporate objectives, based on individual performance. There is also a management bonus paid to managers as a short-term reward for their performance.\nIn addition to financial remuneration and the benefits set forth in law, such as paid vacation and 13 th  month salary, the following benefits are granted:\n· Vacation pay (1/3 in addition to what is required under the legislation).\n· Medical and dental assistance, extensive to children and spouses.\n· Day care for employees' children of pre-school age.\n· Pharmacy allowance, extensive to children and spouses.\n· Maternity (6 months) and paternity leave (28 days).\n· Flexible working hours and hybrid working regime with the option of up to two days of remote working in accordance with the activities exercised by the employee.\n· Private pension plan with co-participation of the Company.\n· Psychological support program, extensive to children and offspring.\n· Quality of life programs, incentivizing the adoption of healthy habits.\n· Life insurance.\n· Meal and/or food vouchers.\n· Travel vouchers and/or contracted transportation to the assets. In 2024, 176 new employees  were hired, 30% more than in 2023.

  "ENGIE Brasil Energia prioritizes well-being in all its forms and based on its institutional policies, endeavors to ensure the physical and psychological health and safety of its employees. It also adopts a series of practices, which are constantly revised and improved to ensure ethics and integrity in its relations and operations, with zero tolerance for any kind of harassment, discrimination and other forms of intolerance and violence, preserving  the freedom of all.\nThe Company's Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) system is aligned with the ISO 45001 guidelines and covers all operations, assets and employees. The procedures help to prevent, control, eliminate or reduce risks, to ensure legal compliance and maintain teams duly oriented.\nThe Risk Management Program (PGR) provides for continuous, multidisciplinary and systematized actions focused on identifying hazards, assessing risks and corresponding preventive measures. The Company treats as 'main risks' those that could lead to accidents with serious consequences and which therefore require actions for dealing with such situations are prioritized. In general, these are related to situations with active energy, high level working, lifting/moving loads, traffic (vehicles, machinery, heavy equipment, etc.), brush clearance and mental health.\nAnother important practice is to encourage employees and service providers to keep a 'mind of risk' and record the risk  situations  identified,  promoting  continuous  improvement  of  the  work  environment  and  strengthening  the culture of safety.\nNumber of hours exposed to risk, 2023 = 2,178,077.

ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  actively  promotes  and  defends  human  rights  and  takes  concrete  action  to  combat discrimination and eliminate inequalities, ensuring a healthy, harmonious work environment marked by respect for all employees. The Company believes that promoting diversity, equity and inclusion is also a way of valuing the richness of differences and diversity of thought, which leads to a greater sense of collaboration and development among professionals and thus, to a more sustainable business growth.\nActions on the subject are guided by the Company's Diversity & Inclusion Policy and the guidelines of Be.U@ENGIE , the ENGIE Group's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy, with commitments formally assumed in five dimensions: gender, race, LGBTQIAPN+, people with disabilities and generational.\nAll  of  the  Company's  employees  are  required  to  undergo  basic  Diversity  &  Inclusion  training,  which  addresses unconscious biases and attitudes in order to make the workplace more inclusive.",
  "One  of  the  commitments  made  in  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  Diversity  &  Inclusion  Policy  is  to  provide  equal opportunities for access to the job market, retention, remuneration and professional growth. This guideline depends significantly on promoting gender equality, which in turn is one of the Company's explicitly stated non-financial objectives.\nA number of ENGIE Brasil Energia programs and initiatives have been increasing women's access to the job market and  reducing  historically  observed  inequalities.  One  example  is  the  Women's  Career  Trail,  which  supports  and develops women in the different stages of building their careers. The target audience is young high school and undergraduate students, who receive free training, which includes instruction on the electricity sector, and bursaries.\nIn addition to promoting the professional development of women, the Company adopts practices to attract this audience, such as:\n· Guaranteeing the name of at least one woman on the final lists of selection processes;\n· Ensuring 50% of the vacancies of the intern, technical and graduation, and Young Apprentices programs are allocated to women;\n· Offering study bursaries in cities close to the assets to stimulate the increase in numbers of female students from nearby teaching institutions participating in courses involving areas of knowledge correlated to O&M. Twenty bursaries were awarded in 2024 and distributed as follows: 12 in Goiás, 7 in Maranhão and 1 in Rio Grande do Sul (one of the bursary holders was appointed as a Maintenance Technician at the Company);\n· Offering affirmative programs for interns with exclusive vacancies for women. The first group graduated in 2023, all 13 graduates being hired as engineers by the Company. In 2024, more than 24 vacancies were offered in all regions of the country, and 21 of them were filled by women. Of the 24 interns, 12  are brown and black interns thus providing  broad-based diversity. All those selected are engineering graduates;\n· Proactively mapping women in the market for future opportunities.\nFor female employees who are already part of the workforce, there are other initiatives focused on developing skills and accelerating careers, such as internal and external mentoring. In addition, to prepare leaders to contribute to this  career  incentive  for  female  employees,  initatives  have  been  introduced  for  awareness-raising,  literacy  and development actions in inclusive leadership management.",

  "ENGIE Brasil Energia's operations and activities are planned and organized based on a rigorous assessment of the use of natural resources, the associated impacts and the interrelationship with the planet and people. More than ensuring  the  legal  compliance  of  its  business  only,  the  Company  is  active  in  building  solutions  to  society's environmental challenges and promoting sustainable development.\nThe main elements of the conservation strategy adopted include risk management, the implementation of actions to mitigate and compensate for impacts and the engagement of stakeholders in the preservation and conservation of  resources  and  the  climate .  Activities  are  guided  by  institutional  policies,  corporate  guidelines  and  voluntary commitments, always with a view to continuously improving environmental performance.\nManagement is also guided by the guidelines of ISO 14001 - Environmental Management, within the scope of the Integrated Management System, which includes the standardization of procedures, the monitoring of indicators and the management of risks and opportunities. Continuous improvement is also driven by the establishment of annual targets involving the most relevant aspects and impacts of each asset and territory.\nENGIE Brasil Energia's environmental practices and guidelines cover diverse aspects such as biodiversity, forests, water, circular economy and climate. · Promote initiatives for the conservation of the biodiversity.\n· Incentivize forestry and regeneration of the ecosystems.\n· Respect the culture of traditional communities.\n· Ensure legal compliance of our assets and projects.\n· Engage stakeholders for conservation of the natural resources.\n· Valorize ecosystemic services and incentivize solutions based on nature.\n· Avoid, reduce, compensate environmental impacts and mitigate socioenvironmental risks.\n· Potentialize the positive impact on territories where we operate.\n· Accelerate the journey for climate ensuring climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience.\n· Control and monitor environmental conditions in our assets.\n· Develop partnerships and contribute to public policies in the sector\n· Create value based on environmental initiatives. The environmental licensing of assets is an important parameter of compliance in the Company's processes and activities. At the end of 2024, ENGIE Brasil Energia was responsible for managing a total of 157 operating licenses - 25 of them are in the renewal phase - and 18 installation licenses, which together amount to more than 3,800 determinants of monitoring and control , compliance with which is supervised by the competent organs. Over the course of the year, 27 new Operating Licenses were obtained while 15 were renewed, demonstrating operations 100% compliant.\nAs in the case of the last five fiscal years, the  Company was not subject to any significant monetary sanctions (sanctions of more than USD 10,000 are considered significant) due to non-compliance with legal requirements or environmental impacts. Biodiversity  is  one  of  the  priority  focuses  of  ENGIE  Brasil Energia's conservation strategy, particularly due to its interdependence  with  the  climate  issue  -  there  will  be  no climate neutrality without conservation of biodiverse areas, nor will it be possible to reduce biodiversity loss without mitigating the  effects  of  climate  change.  In  this  sense,  the  Company's Sustainable  Management  Policy  establishes the  sustainable use of natural resources as a premise for action, minimizing the ecological  footprint  on  water,  air,  soil,  forests  and  climate, having as a priority reducing pressure on biodiversity , together with the conservation of water resources .",
  "To this end, ENGIE Brasil Energia has begun to incorporate the guidelines  laid  down  by  the  Taskforce  on  Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) into its environmental initiatives, based on the material challenges of conservation facing each Brazilian biome, from a territorial perspective, acting continuously  to  maximize  the  means  of  positively  impacting nature.\nAmong its assets, ENGIE Brasil Energia operates eight nurseries in eight Brazilian states, contributing  to  the  conservation  of  the  local biomes  through  the  production  of  seedlings  of species native to  four of the six Brazilian biomes for planting not only in the Company's areas but also those of third parties, through donations to schools  and  local  communities.  Donations  are usually  made  in  the  context  of  activities  of  an educational  character  with  events  promoted  in schools or community spaces. The seedlings are also used for the protection of headwater springs such as in the recovery of Permanent Preservation  Areas  (APPs)    and  Conservation UInits  in  the  regions  in  close  proximity  to  the assets.  In 2024,  the  Company  either  planted and/or donated more than 255 thousand seedlings.\nAs  a basis for the strategy, the model adopts the five domains proposed by the TNFD: Earth, FreshWater, Society, Atmosphere and Oceans. In order to establish guidelines for the implementation of the subprograms, projects and initiatives related to these themes, six key methods of execution were established:\n· Measuring of impacts/pressures on the biodiversity in the ecosystems/territories;\n· Management of risks and opportunities relative to the biodiversity of the territories;\n· Economic valuation of the local biodiversity;\n· Fostering conservation of the biodiversity along the value chain;\n· Partnerships for biomass conservation; and\n· Research, Development and Innovation. ENGIE Brasil Energia's environmental conservation strategy relies on the engagement of local communities as a  way  of  multiplying  efforts  and  maximizing  positive  impacts  from  the  actions  implemented.  To  this  end, environmental  education  initiatives  are  developed,  both  at  operational  assets  and  at  projects  under implementation, with a view to sustainable development.\nSome of the actions are carried out as part of the environmental licensing of the assets and involve guidance for employees and members of the community, through lectures and educational materials. In those assets where  the  Environmental  Education  program  linked  to  the  licensing  has  already  been  completed,  other activities are planned, linked to the Connection Program, for a diversified audience made up of communities, public and private schools, public authorities and the academic and scientific community in general.\nConnection also offers routine public visits to the plants and other facilities in the company's generator park, thereby facilitating understanding of how the assets work, the energy generation process and its interfaces with the environment and society. It also addresses relevant socio-environmental issues with participants, such as climate change and its consequences. Over the course of 2024, more than 122,000 participants were logged.",
  "The sustainable and responsible use of water resources is  a  fundamental  premise of ENGIE Brasil Energia's operations and a priority expressly established  in  its  Sustainable  Management  Policy. Water  is  an  essential  resource  not  only  for  the Company's operations, but for society and the planet as a whole.\nIn  2024, the total volume of water withdrawn from sources was 3.2 thousand megaliters, a reduction of 12.2% on the previous year.\nThe  commitment  to  promoting  the  efficient  use  of water  resources  is  also  expressed  in  the  ENGIE Group's  Non-Financial  Objectives,  estimating  water consumption  in  relation  to  energy  produced  at  0.1\nm3/kwh  by  2030.  As  well  as  focusing  on  reducing  consumption,  the  Company  works  to  identify  potential contributions to water conservation, with quality and availability. To  ensure  compliance  with  quality  standards  superior  to  the  parameters  required  by  the  legislation  in  the conservation of water resources, the Company permanently monitors the quality of surface water in the reservoirs it manages. This control is performed with the support of specialized and independent companies, reinforcing the reliability of the data collected.\nIn  2024,  the  consolidated  results  of  the  monitoring  classified  the  water  quality  of  the  reservoirs,  in  general,  as 'excellent' or 'good', according to the methodology established by the State of São Paulo Environmental Protection Agency (Cetesb) for the Water Quality Index. In addition to the artificial reservoirs, ENGIE Brasil Energia monitors surface and ground water quality at other points, depending on the location and needs of each asset.\nIn addition, it has Emergency Response Plans, which cover the risks of accidents or incidents with a potential impact on water resources. The plans establish how to prepare for and respond to emergency situations, the training of local teams and the materials needed, such as equipment to contain leaks and oil and water separators.",
  "With the intention of acting to accelerate the energy transition to a low-carbon economy, ENGIE Brasil Energia has been intensifying its participation in the public debate on climate change and the urgency of action to tackle global warming.\nWith a 100% renewable energy generator park, ENGIE Brasil Energia plays an important role in the global climate targets set by the ENGIE Group. The Company's climate strategy includes decarbonizing its operations and value chain,  expanding  renewable  energies,  investing  in  transmission  and  other  energy  infrastructures  and  offering efficient and sustainable solutions to support customers and partners on their own journeys. It also includes strict control  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and  the  continuous  improvement  of  management,  mitigation  and adaptation processes to reduce the business's carbon footprint.\nTo facilitate the consolidation of the climate strategy, risk management and monitoring of the metrics and targets established, ENGIE Brasil Energia has created a governance platform -Journey for the Climate - structured on three pillars: management, mitigation and adaptation. The program was drawn up on the basis of a diagnosis covering the Company's direct and indirect emissions, as well as the materiality of Scope 3, which accounts for over 90% of emissions and is the current focus of the Journey, in this way ensuring total control of emissions in the value chain.",

This progress has allowed the Company to join the CDP's A List bringing those companies leading the energy transition together. The progress in the ranking is a demonstration that the Company is continually investing in the adoption of the best practices identified in the market, being recognized as a company leader in the climate change theme. The assessment of the Company in the 2023 cycle was well above the average for South America which was a  B  grade,    and  greater  than  recorded  by  the renewable energy generation sector, also a B. ENGIE was among  33% of the companies in the CDP which reached the leadership level in its sector of activity for the implementation of the best practices recognized by organizations such as TCFD and the Accountability Framework. In 2024,  the Company also  achieved    an  'A'  grade  -  in  the  Supplier Engagement Rating, which evaluates performance in governance, targets, Scope 3 emissions and engagement of the value chain in the climate change scenario.\nAs already mentioned the assessment relating to the 2024 cycle was only recently published and greater details and stratifications on the result are still not available.",
  "Aware of the impacts that its operations can have, especially in the vicinity of its assets, ENGIE Brasil Energia is attentive  to  these  territories  and  seeks  to  position  itself  as  an agent  of  social  transformation .  The  Company's Sustainable Management Policy expressly states this commitment. The document establishes as a premise for action the creation of value in a shared manner , based on actively listening to these stakeholders and promoting projects and initiatives that bring about sustainable development and quality of life.\nThus, the definition of programs, investments and actions of social responsibility is conducted in a participatory manner, through a transparent and cooperative relationship with the communities. In addition to meeting previously mapped demands, the aim is to promote, as a priority, access to education, culture and sport, income generation, as well as protecting children and young people. The actions promoted also foster associativism and cooperativism, empowering  communities  and  enabling  more  consistent  and  lasting  results,  improving  the  socio-economic conditions of the most vulnerable social groups\nIn 2024, the Company established a priority area for investment in social responsibility: Social Welfare. Aimed at promoting the health of people living in communities close to the assets, the new program includes  a  series  of  actions  aimed  at  preventing  chronic  noncommunicable diseases and facilitating primary access to health.\nIn 2024, more  than R$ 48 million was  invested in socioenvironmental projects , including voluntary investments, unrelated to the licensing process, in the regions where the projects are being implemented.

  "One of the most important actions in the area of access to culture and education are the Culture and Sustainability Centers ,  set  up and supported in the vicinity of the assets by ENGIE Brasil Energia, mainly through incentivized funds, but also with funds from partner companies, via the Partnerships for Good program. More than 400 children attend the workshops offered at the Culture Centers and more than 4,000 young people have received assistance through their intermediary. By the end of 2024, six Centers were in operation, in the municipalities of Alto Bela Vista (SC), Concórdia (SC), Entre Rios do Sul (RS), Quedas do Iguaçu (PR), Minaçu (GO) and Trairi (CE), the latter being the last to start operating, after being unveiled in June, in celebration of the Trairi Wind Complex's ten years of operation. The event featured concerts and performances, including the Bolshoi Theater's first visit to the city. Engaged in the defense of human rights and the elimination of inequalities, ENGIE Brasil Energia adopts initiatives aimed at expanding female entrepreneurship and women's access to the labor market . Since 2020, the Company has offered a permanent program, called Women in Our Neighborhood, which aims to boost gender equity based on four fundamental axes: education, health, creation of income and combating domestic violence. Each year, a new call for proposals is launched and the Company selects businesses led by women (cisgender and transgender), who receive  R$  10,000  each  in  financial  support,  as  well  as  free  training  in  entrepreneurial  education  and  business management. Participants also receive advice on support networks and physical and mental health. As part of the program, awareness-raising activities are offered as part of the process of tackling domestic violence.\nThe 5 th Call for Proposals, launched in 2024 and the largest since the Program was created, focused on businesses led by black women and/or mothers - the previous edition also prioritized the empowerment of black women. 100 initiatives were selected, in 65 cities in 22 Brazilian states, totaling R$1 million. The selection took into account the economic viability of the businesses, their continuity following financial support, their alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals and their potential to have a positive impact on the local community.",
  "Convinced that education can accelerate social transformation and drive sustainable development, ENGIE Brasil Energia supports projects and actions that promote access to education and improve the capacity children and adolescents to learn. One of the most important initiatives in this area is the call for educational proposals, launched annually by the Company since 2021. The aim is to recognize and encourage innovative and inclusive projects that benefit primary and high school students in public and private schools in the regions where the Company operates. More than 25,000 children and teenagers have already been impacted.\nIn  2024,  the 4 th Call  for  Educational  Projects prioritized  projects  focused  on  mental  health  or  initiatives  that promoted  instrumental  disciplines  (Portuguese  and  Mathematics),  which  are  important  in  contributing  to  the evolution of the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB). In all, 36 projects were selected from 29 municipalities located in 12 states. The winners received an incentive of R$ 10,000 each, to be invested in the projects, as well as the monitoring of the activities for a period of 12 months. Seeking to broaden the scope of its social responsibility initiatives, ENGIE Brasil Energia launched the Parcerias do Bem (Goodwill Partnerships) program in 2021 to attract customers and partners from different sectors to engage in actions and projects with a positive impact . In 2024, and three years into its existence, more than 60,000 people had already benefited from around 200 projects executed through more than 80 partner companies - of these, 52 were still active at the end of 2024. R$ 9 million was invested in income generation, education, health and culture. Over the course of the year, 91 projects were signed, directly benefiting 24,000 people. In support of those affected by the floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in the first half of the year, ENGIE Brasil Energia allocated around R$ 900,000 to actions and projects focused on health, economic recovery and community development.",

  "The guidelines and values that guide ENGIE Brasil Energia's business, as well as the commitments it makes in the ESG sphere, are extended to its suppliers. The Company's Sustainable Management Policy expressly stipulates that suppliers must comply with ethical, social and environmental responsibility and occupational health and safety requirements, including contractual requirements .  The regulations reflect the concern directed at ENGIE's value chain and its importance in managing business impacts and risks.\nIn 2024, a number of policies were reviewed by ENGIE Brasil Energia, including the Code of Conduct in Supplier Relations  and  updated  in  May.  The  document  sets  out  seven  principles  that  must  be  followed  and  orientates suppliers  as  to  how  they  should  adhere  to  these  guidelines  in  their  own  supply  chain  relationships.  Other commitments and expectations related to suppliers are presented in the Procurement Policy. The assessment practices applied by the Company for managing suppliers are aligned with ENGIE's Due Diligence Policy, which provides for measures to mitigate the risks of corruption and other transgressions of the environmental and human rights guidelines that guide its operations. In addition to preventing and managing risks, these practices contribute to the development of business partners. They are:\n· Ethical analysis prior to the entry of any new supplier : this is carried out using an automated platform with big  data  resources  and  covers,  among  other  items,  environmental,  social  and  ethical  aspects  (including embargo measures for countries classified as a risk, under the terms of the Company's and ENGIE Group's Embargo Policy). The analysis is reapplied to the entire supply chain on an annual basis.\n· Quarterly assessment of long-term suppliers or critical suppliers , when they provide services within ENGIE Brasil Energia's facilities: the assessment covers four approaches - commercial, social, environmental and health and safety - and is conducted by the Company's teams, which directly monitor the execution of activities. In the event of poor performance, action plans are drawn up to address the points of correction and improvement identified, with the support and monitoring of the Company.\n· Evaluation conducted by an independent external company and with more indepth criteria for the 'top 50' suppliers ,  which receive larger volumes of funds in the year: this evaluation looks at criteria such as convictions for acts of improbity, association with labor analogous to forced labor, registration in registers of unfit or punished companies and processes linked to environmental violations, among others.\n· Reputational  monitoring ,  using  the  'RepRisk'  tool:  this  applies  to  two  profiles  of  suppliers:  long -term suppliers and those where turnover in business with the Company is more significant.\nIn the event of an unsatisfactory result in any of these analyses, the supplier is disqualified from joining or remaining on ENGIE Brasil Energia's list of business partners. In addition to the assessments listed above, the processes of procurement  and  management of suppliers are  also  subject  to  external  audits  of  ISO  9001,  14001  and  45001 certification.",
  "The program that manages ESG aspects in ENGIE Brasil Energia's supply chain has been an important tool for maturing and sensitizing suppliers with regard to sustainable development and the promotion of positive impacts on society.\nThe execution of actions is planned considering the results of surveys of suppliers in order to understand the current stage of maturity of each of them in ESG practices and the main bottlenecks faced in internalizing this culture in their activities. This identifies the risks involved in each supply and the points of priority development to be worked on with each partner.\nThis management process is also aligned with the Supplier Decarbonization Program, implemented by ENGIE Brasil Energia to support the achievement of the targets established in its Journey for the Climate.\nIt is estimated that, through the initiatives provided in the Program, there will be a reduction of more than 100,000 tCO2 e,  which  corresponds  to  more  than  20%  of  the  Company's  total  emissions,  which  in  2024  included  the participation of 39 mapped suppliers who underwent the Maturity Diagnosis. In this first year, more than 59% of eligible suppliers joined the initiative, taking part in training courses, as well as receiving instructions and support in accounting for their emissions through the Descarbonize platform.",
  "At the end of 2024, ENGIE Brasil Energia's commercial portfolio consisted of 1,854 free customers, responsible for 3,826 United Consumers, which together accounted for 7.5% of the market share . The close relationship with this market segment allows the Company to remain competitive, developing actions to prospect for new consumers and retain the loyalty of those already captive. It also makes it possible to keep abreast of market demands and trends in order to identify solutions that facilitate energy management and, at the same time, help accelerate the energy transition.\nIn this sense, ENGIE Brasil Energia positions itself as a partner for companies seeking to decarbonize their operations, with  specific  solutions  for  offsetting  carbon  emissions  in  the  three  scopes:  direct  emissions  (scope  1),  indirect emissions from energy purchases (scope 2) and indirect emissions from sources over which the Company has no control (scope 3). The main solutions offered for decarbonization are :\n· I-RECs  and  ENGIE-RECs  (Renewable  Energy  Certificates): certifies  that  electricity  is  consumed  from renewable sources, with no GHG emissions. The certificate is internationally recognized and can be used to neutralize Scope 2 emissions. Over the course of 2024, 12.5 thousand GWh were sold through the issue of I-RECs and ENGIE-RECs.\n· Carbon credits: allow direct and indirect GHG emissions from Scopes 1, 2 and 3 to be offset, including remnants from periods prior to the current year of the GHG inventory. In 2024, 74,700 carbon credits were issued which the Company can sell in the future. And companies interested in accessing credits can also use the Descarbonize platform to make it easier to calculate and manage their emissions.\nIn  addition,  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  offers  digital  products  and  solutions  aimed  at  facilitating  the  migration  of companies to the free energy market and their transactions, a function that is becoming increasingly relevant as the ACL gradually opens up to new consumer profiles. In 2024, 446 new free customers were acquired, an increase of 31.7% compared to 2023 .\nOne of ENGIE Brasil Energia's solutions that fulfills this role is E-conomiza, a line of products for consumers seeking to reduce energy costs and which facilitates migration to the ACL, especially for small and middle market companies. This solution also increases consumer autonomy, allowing a business to self-manage its energy.\nAnother highlight is Energy Place, a digital platform that works like an energy e-commerce for all ACL agents. Here it is possible to quote and buy short- and long-term energy and manage contracts and seasonalization strategies in a practical and 100% digital way.\nTo further strengthen its relationship with free market customers, the Company has expanded the contact channels available and added new partners to the team of representatives it has in different regions of the country to generate business in the free energy market, bringing the service closer to the customer.\nAnother initiative is the maintenance of a customer success program which, among other actions, conducts surveys to identify opportunities for improvement. Each customer responds to the survey once a year. The satisfaction rate in 2024 was 94.9% - in 2023 it was 93.5%.",
  "With transparency and trust as premises in its relationship with all its stakeholders, ENGIE Brasil Energia maintains a proactive stance in making information available to its investors. As such, it reports results systematically and does not limit itself to financial information, sharing results relating to all aspects of the business.\nMaterial  facts,  reports,  notices  to  shareholders  and  other  communications  to  the  market  are  published  in  the 'Investors' area of the Company's website, as well as CVM and B3 pages. Other pertinent guidelines are contained in the Information Disclosure and Securities Trading Policy.\nENGIE Brasil Energia also holds quarterly meetings with investors and market analysts to present results and discuss strategies. In doing so, it strengthens its relationship with this audience, encourages their participation in relevant discussions and inc reases the transparency of this relationship. In addition, it holds the annual 'Inside ENGIE Brasil Energia',  a  public  meeting  broadcast  through  the  Company's  YouTube  channel,  in which  it  discusses  the  year's results, strategies, challenges and opportunities in the electricity sector. · 184 analysts and institutional investors attended via conferences and non-deal roadshows.\n· 5.5 thousand at the quarterly results video-conferences.\n· 8 lives with a focus on the personal investor (with more than 9 thousand views).\n· 1.6 thousand participants at the the investor day 'Inside ENGIE' (38 onsite).\n· 55.8 thousand visits to the investor website during the year.",
  "The global economic panorama in 2024 was marked by stronger growth than the previous year, particularly due to the reduction in inflation rates, without any major adverse impact on economic activity and to the reduction of interest rates by the American and European central banks. However, complex geopolitical conflicts  such as the wars  between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, maintain an unstable scenario in place with the possibility of a fresh inflationary spiral.\nIn Brazil, the economy performed above the world average. I t is estimated that GDP rose close to 3.5%, the highest for the past three years although the official figure has still not been released. The result will be aided by the good performance for the services sector and  the increase in government expenditure. In parallel, economic growth was responsible for the decline in unemployment, this reaching its lowest level of the historical series.\nConversely, inflation was pressured, ending outside  the upper limit of the Brazilian  Central Bank, both due to increased demand for products and services generated by economic growth, the effects of drought on the price of food stuffs and electric energy and by the appreciation of the US Dollar which produced upward pressure on both the prices of imported products as well as commodities. The PTAX rate of the USDollar closed the year at R$ 6.19, approximately 28% higher than the quotation at the close of 2023, which was R$ 4.84. In a scenario of inflationary pressures, the Central Bank increased the basic Selic rate and is promising further increases for 2025 to ensure that the interest rate curve  returns  on target which is 3% p.a., with an upper limit of the Central Bank interest  rate band set at 4.5% a.a.",
  "As the global demand for electricity increases, the outline of a new energy system is emerging. In the last decade, the use of electricity has grown twice as fast as general demand for energy. However from now until 2035, it can be expected to grow six times as fast thanks to the growing adoption of electric-powered vehicles, air conditioning, chips, artifical intelligence, among others. Based on the shape of current policies, low emission sources should be responsible  for  generating  more  than  half  world  demand  before  2030.  However,  for  each  US  Dollar  spent  on renewable energy, only 60 centavos are expended today on networks and storage. Safe decarbonization of the electric  sector  requires  that  investment  in  networks  and  storage  grow  still  faster  than  investments  in  clean generation. Additionally, many energy systems are currently vulnerable to a series of threats, including an increase in extreme climate events and cyber attacks. This places a premium on efforts to reinforce the resilience  and the digital security of energy systems.\nIn Brasil, electricity energy consumption was 560,219 GWh, a growth of 5.3% in relation to 2023 of 531,881 GWh. The regulated market (ACR) decreased 7.1% while the free market (ACL) increased 10.6%. Growth in the residential sector was 7.1%, industrial 4.8%, commercial 5.2% and others 3.1%. Meanwhile between regions of the country, growth was remarkably uniform, being greatest in the North (6.9%) and the lowest in the Southeast (5.0%).",
  "The  high  degree  of  uptime  of  the  assets  and  their  operational  efficiency  are  also  a  result  of  investments  in modernization of the plants, an example being the Miranda Hydropower Plant with 408 MW, located in Indianópolis (MG). In 2024, the Company concluded the modernizaton of plant  control and instrumentation systems, begun in 2022.\nThe  initiative  is  even  more  significant  when  it  is  remembered  that  hydropower  is  operated  remotely  by  the Generation Operations Center out  of ENGIE Brasil Energia's headquarters in Florianópolis (SC). The Center provides greater security and reliability in the monitoring of generation.\nOver the year, progress continued to be made on the project for modernizing the Salto Osório (PR), Ponte de Pedra (MT) and Jaguara (SP) hydropower plants. At Salto Osório, the project, deemed as a major one in terms of size, includes the replacement of equipment and systems with the most modern technologies, work on all six generator units expected to be concluded by 2025. At Ponte de Pedra, the engineering project is advancing  on schedule with estimated completion set for 2026. At Jaguara, work in progress is expected to proceed until 2028, increasing the useful life, reliability and availability of the assets, with the respective concession term expiring in 2048.\nThe  photovoltaic  assets  are  also  undergoing  modernization  involving  operational  improvements  and  enhanced performance. At the Paracatu Photovoltaic Complex,  the Company is undertaking repair work in wind damage in April 2023 and covered by an insurance policy for material damage and loss of earnings. The Assu V, Paracatu and Floresta photovoltaic plants are also modernizing tracker control and communication systems. At Paracatu, work has been completed with the full restoration of the generation panel equipment, trackers and structures which had been damaged by an extreme weather event. The Complex now has a new Generator Park IV with more modern, efficient and resistant equipment.",
  "In 2024, taking into consideration all scheduled and forced stoppages, the plants operated by ENGIE Brasil Energia recorded an uptime ratio of 89.6% , namely 91.9% for hydropower plants and 80.9% in the case of plants powered from complementary energy sources. There was a reduction of 3.0 p.p. in global uptime, being 1.8 p.p. for the hydropower plants and 6.6 p.p. for the complementary units.\nUptime  at  the  hydropower  plants,  compared  to  2023,  was  influenced  by  the  disconnection  of  the  Number  2 Generator Unit at the Salto Santiago Hydropower Plant due to repair work on the turbine rotor at the manufacturer, operations only being resumed in January 2025.\nWith respect to the complementary plants, the reduction in uptime ratio was impacted largely by the stoppage of the Number 4 Generator Unit of  the  Ferrari  Thermoelectric  Power  Plant,  corrective  maintenance carried out on the wind generators at the Umburanas Wind Complex as well as maintenance on the Rondonópolis SHP.\nUptime Operating (c onsidering scheduled shutdowns) Engie Brasil Energia recorded a strong operational performance from its Gralha Azul and Novo Estado transmission assets with total uptime of 99.99% in the twelve months  of 2024. This percentage is an improvement on 2023, when the total accumulated uptime was 99.95%. The  transmission assets have  turned  in an excellent operational performance since their entry into commercial operations.",
  "For calendar year 2024 , global generation from the plants operated by ENGIE Brasil Energia was  54,223 GWh (6,173 average  MW),  24.2% greater  than  2023 when  total  generated  was  43,662  GWh  (4,984\naverage MW), discounting output from the Pampa Sul Thermoelectric Power Plant divested in May 2023.\nAt the hydropower plants, annual production in 2024 was 45,770 GWh (5,211 average MW), 23.1% higher than 2023. Since the hydrological conditions were largely unchanged year-on-year, the differences can be ascribed to the operational policy of the National Interconnected System (SIN) and specific interventions at the generator units.\nAs for the complementary plants, power output in 2024 was 8,452 GWh (962 average MW), 30.2% greater than the previous year. This enhanced production is due primarily to the startup in operations at the Santo Agostinho and Serra do Assuruá wind complexes and the acquisition of the aforementioned photovoltaic plants.\nAlso worth recalling is that the increase in the Company's hydropower generation does not necessarily improve economicfinancial performance. Similarly, a reduction in this type of generation does not necessarily imply a deterioration in economic-financial performance. This is due to the application of the Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE), where the inherent hydrological risks of hydropower generation are shared proportionally among MRE participants.",
  "According  to  the  National  Electric  System  Operator's  (ONS),  there  are  three  main  categories  of  curtailment: Energetic (when it is impossible to allocate generation to the load), Electrical Reliability (due to reasons related to the electrical reliability of equipment external to the plants) and External Unavailability (caused by unavailability of facilities external to the plants). Of these, External Unavailability allows the agent to potentially be reimbursed for generation limitations conditional on compliance with established Aneel and ONS parameters.\nAccording to an analysis of the data published by the ONS in 2024, the wind and solar power plants operated by ENGIE Brasil Energia recorded 9% generation curtailment, compared to 8% recorded in the other plants in the National  Interconnected  System  (SIN).  Of  this  total,  the  Company's  wind  farms  recorded  a  8%  reduction  in production compared to 7% in the SIN, and 16% in solar versus 15% for the SIN, as can be seen in the following graphs: Source: In-house study by ENGIE Brasil Energia based on assumptions published by the ONS and subject to updates. In 2024, transmitted gas volumes were 29.9 million m3/day (31.7 million m3/day in 2023). Extraordinary agreement volume was 10.6 million m3/day, representing approximately 11% of TAG's total contracted volume, and 15% if only  the  integrated  network  (excluding  Gas  Transportation  Pipeline  (GTA) Urucu-Manaus, where Petrobras remains sole carrier) is considered. In 2024, TAG signed 228 firm agreements (45 active) with 24 distributors.\ngas",

  "· Net Average Selling Price and Sales Volume\nThe  average  selling  price  of  energy,  net  of  charges  on  revenue  and  trading operations was R$ 220.79/MWh, 2.5% lower than the R$ 226.42/MWh practiced in 2023.\nDisregarding the impact of the reimbursements, the average energy selling price decreased from R$ 228.90 in 2023 to R$ 226.26 in 2024, a reduction of 1.2%. Reimbursements are caused by the delivery of wind and solar energy in amounts inferior  to  those  below  agreed  contractual  amounts  in  the  regulated  contracting environment with the distributors.\nThe reduction in price between the periods under analysis was driven mainly, (i) by the improvement in the hydrological scenario in the past few years, combined with the increase in renewable energy and growth in distributed generation, impacting energy  prices  in the free market  comprising  Free  Consumers  and  Trading Companies.  Additionally,  no  significant  operations  were  undertaken  since  the deterioration in the hydrological scenario  beginning of 2024, given the good level of contracting  for the portfolio; (ii) growth  in  the  reimbursements  already mentioned; and (iii) by the divestment of Pampa Sul TPP in May 2023, this plant's energy sales being conducted at prices higher than the remainder of the Company's portfolio; partially offset by the (iv) acquisition of the Juazeiro, São Pedro, Sol do Futuro,  Sertão  Solar  and  Lar do  Sol photovoltaic  complexes  ('Photovoltaic Complexes'), assets which have their energy output contracted at higher prices than the average for the remainder of the portfolio; and (v) monetary restatement of the current  long-term  agreements.  Excluding  the  effects  of  the  sale  of  Pampa  Sul, average selling prices would have fallen 1.8% between the years under analysis.",
  "The variation was a reflection of the acquisition of the Photovoltaic Complexes and by the increase in sales to the free contracting environment due to the growth in  proprietary  installed  capacity  between  the  periods  under  analysis  although attenuated by the decrease in sales volume to the distributors following the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary.\nThe variation in sales volume and in average prices together produced a reduction of R$ 146 million in the Company's net operating revenue - R$ 300 million relates to the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary in the secound quarter of 2023. - Distribution Companies 1 - Net of sale taxes and trading operations. In 2024, revenue amounted to R$ 4,077 million, a reduction of R$ 29 million (0.7%) in relation to 2023, when it was R$ 4,106 million. This decrease is explained by\n1 - Net of trading operations.\nthe following items: (i) a decline of R$ 124 million due to the reduction of 438 GWh (54 average MW) in volumes sold; and (ii) an increase of R$ 95 million due to the 2.3% rise in net average selling price. These results are primarily a consequence of the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary, which had a commercial capacity of 323.5 average MW, partially offset by the acquisition of the Photovoltaic Complexes.\nThe increase in net average selling price between the years under analysis was mainly driven by (i) the acquisition of the Photovoltaic Complexes, assets with energy contracted at prices higher than other revenues in the Regulated Contracting Environment; and (ii) the monetary restatement of selling prices in the compared periods; offset (iii) by the aforementioned reimbursements.\nExcluding the impact of the aforementioned reimbursements, the net average selling price to distributors increased by 5.1% between the years analysed.",
  "In 2024, revenue reached R$ 2,908 million, an amount R$ 268 million (8.4%) down on the R$ 3,176 million recorded in  2023.  This  decrease  was  due  to  the  reduction  of  4.5%  in  net  average  selling  price  (R$  143  million)  and  the reduction of 629 GWh (76 average MW) in energy sales volume (R$ 125 million). Results were impacted by the decrease in  free  market  energy prices.  The  reduction  recorded  in  the  amount  of  energy  sold  is  a  consequence substantially of the following factors: (i) the expiring of agreements; (ii) the change in commercialization class of existing customers in the Company's Free Consumer  portfolio to the Trading Company classification, given current advantages  for  this  economic  group;  and  offset  (iii)  by  the  entry  into  operation  of  the  Serra  do  Assuruá  Wind Complex. In the calendar year 2024, revenues were R$ 978 million, R$ 151 million (18.3%) greater than the revenue recorded in 2023 of R$ 827 million. This increase is the result of the increase of 1,315 GWh (148 average MW) in energy sales volume (R$ 193 million), attenuated by the decline of 5.2% in net average selling price (R$ 42 million). The reduction in net average selling prices is due basically to the decrease in energy prices on the free market, caused by  the  improvement  in  the  hydrological  scenario,  as  already  explained,  combined  with  the  increased  supply  of renewable energy over the past few years, factors attenuated by the monetary restatement of current agreements. The increase in volumes is mainly due to the entry into effect of new agreements, the acquisition of the Lar do Sol Photovoltaic  Complex,  and  the  already  mentioned  change  in  classification  from  Free  Consumers  to  Trading Companies.",
  "In 2024, revenue generated in the short-term market reached R$ 484 million, marking an increase of R$ 96 million (24.7%)  compared  to  the  R$  388  million  recorded  in  2023.  Further  explanations  on  these  operations  and  on variations may be obtained in 'Details of short-term operations.' The  financial  assets  of  concessions  represent  the  present  value  of  future  cash  flows  of  the  portion  of  energy allocated  to  the  Regulated  Contracting  Environment  (ACR)  of  the  Jaguara  and  Miranda  hydropower  plants, equivalent to 70% of the physical guarantee of these plants. These assets are remunerated at the annual internal rate of return and according to the variation in the Amplified Consumer Price Index (IPCA).\nRemuneration of financial assets of concessions increased R$ 31 million (6.6%) between the years in analysis, from R$ 468 million in 2023 to R$ 499 million in 2024, the result largely due to the increase in the IPCA between periods under comparison. During 2024, the Company reported the amount of R$ 262 million, arising from indemnifications for non-compliance with contractual conditions by the supplier responsible for the construction of the Santo Agostinho Wind Complex, largely related to the delay in the conclusion of the work.\nThe  other  amounts  disclosed  under  this  heading,  in  the  years  and  quarters  under  analysis,  reflect  contractual penalties for downtime relating to the O&M contracts for the wind farms comprising the Campo Largo, Campo Largo II, Trairi and Umburanas wind complexes.",

Operational costs, Consolidated = 271\nIn 2024, operational costs were R$ 5,112 million, R$ 271 million higher (5.6%) compared with operational costs in 2023 of R$ 4,841 million. This variation was a reflection of the combination of the following factors: (i) growth of R$ 236 million (76.1%) in the costs of the transmission segment, largely due to the increase in construction costs of the  Asa  Branca  and  Gavião  Real  transmission  systems;  (ii)  an  increase  of  R$  175  million  (4.3%)  in  the  energy generation and sales segment of the portfolio; and a (iii) reduction of R$ 140 million (32.2%) in the costs of energy trading operations\nThe change in the energy generation and sales from the portfolio segment is essentially due to movement of the main components as follows:",
  "· Energy purchases: There was a decrease of R$ 221 million (14.8%) in these operations in the annual comparison, largely the result of a combination of the following events: (i) R$ 139 million - a reduction of 9.9% in the net average purchasing price of energy; and (ii) R$ 82 million - a decline of 456 GWh (52 average MW) in the amount of energy purchased. The variation in average purchasing prices was a reflection of the improvement in the hydrological outlook at the time of contracting, as mentioned above, combined with an increase in the supply of renewable energy over recent years, factors which have depressed energy prices on the free market. Variations in volume reflect the management of the portfolio of the Company, which has seen an increase in proprietary installed capacity over recent years, this in turn, reducing the need for energy purchases from third parties during the interval between the two compared periods.\n· Depreciation and amotization: increases of R$ 147 million (16.9%) between years analyzed. The variation can be explained mainly in the light of the acquisition of the Photovoltaic Complexes and by the start-up in commercial operations of the Santo Agostinho and Serra do Assuruá wind complexes in March 2023 and August 2024, respectively.\n· Material and third-party services: increases of R$ 96 million (25.9%) between years analyzed. The leading drivers here are as follows: (i) the rendering of consultancy and advisory services; (ii) repair and maintenance work on the Company's hydropower plants and wind farms; (iii) an increase in IT expenditures; (iv) costs involved in the acquisition of the Photovoltaic Complexes; and (v) the entry into commercial operations of the  Santo  Agostinho  and  Serra  do  Assuruá  wind  complexes.  The  impact  of  the  annual  variation  was attenuated by the divestment of the Pampa Sul TPP.\n· Charges for use of the network and connection : growth of R$ 38 million (5.7%)  between years analyzed, largely  the  result  of:  (i)  the  acquisition  of  the  Photovoltaic  Complexes;  (ii)  the  entry  into  commercial operations  of  the  Santo  Agostinho  and  Serra  do  Assuruá  wind  complexes;  and  (iii)  the  annual  tariff readjustment for the transmission and distribution business segment. The annual variation was offset by the sale of Pampa Sul TPP.\n· Transactions in the  short-term energy market: costs  with  these  transactions  were  R$  70  million  lower (34.8%) when these overheads are analyzed on an annual basis. Further explanations on these operations and on variations may be obtained in 'Details of short-term operations.'\n· Financial Compensation for the use of water resources (royalties): an increase of R$ 56 million (33.1%) between years, by virtue of the increased generation from the hydropower plants in addition to the annual adjustment in annual royalties.\n· Insurance: increases of R$ 35 million (41.2%) in insurance costs between years analyzed, largely the result of: (i) the acquisition of the Photovoltaic Complexes; (ii) the start-up in commercial operations of the Santo Agostinho and Serra do Assuruá wind complexes; and (iii) the annual readjustment of insurance premiums. The year-on-year variation was offset by the divestment of Pampa Sul TPP.\n· Renegotiation of the hydrological risk : Law 13,360/16 decrees that Aneel may add the days involved in delay of start-up of plant operations caused by factors outside the control of the agent and recognized by the regulator. On the basis of this Law, Aneel's Technical Note 877/2022 ruled that these days be allocated to the extension of the GSF (Generation Scaling Factor). On April 27, 2023, Aneel requested CCEE to verify the  calculations  for  extending  the  concession  term,  the  outcome  being  an  increase  of  852  days  in  the concession term of Estreito HPP. Subsequent to a recalculation, on May 10, 2023, the CCEE published their findings  resulting  in  a  further  620  days  over  and  above  the  number  of  days  previously  calculated. Consequently, the effect on the result of this transaction was a net gain of R$ 115 million in 2023.",
  "· Fuel for generation : a decrease of R$ 66 million (100.0%) when comparing the consecutive calendar years. The variation was impacted by the sale of the Pampa Sul TPP and the Lages Co-generation Plant (UCLA), respectively finalized in May 2023 and June 2024. The Company has primary responsibility for the construction and installation of infrastructure pertaining to the Gralha Azul, Novo Estado, Gavião Real and Asa Branca transmission systems and is exposed to the risks and benefits of these constructions. Consequently, based on prevailing accounting practices, the Company books revenue over the course of the implementation of the transmission infrastructure for an amount corresponding to the construction costs  plus  a  gross  margin  on  the  construction  services  provided.  Expenditures  incurred  in  the  construction  are recognized in the cost of the transmission infrastructure. The Annual Allowed Revenue (RAP) is received once the transmission system goes into commercial operations. Thus, only resources generated from operational activities are received from then onwards. The Gralha Azul and Novo Estado transmission systems went into full commercial operations on February 19 and 27, 2023, respectively. In addition, on July 8, 2024, the  Company finalized the implementation of the Gavião Real Transmission System project with the complete energization of its substation as incorporated in the Delivery and Acceptance Certificate (TLD) issued by the National System Operator (ONS) on July 12, 2024.\nIn 2024, the gross result was R$ 975 million, R$ 150 million (18.2%) higher than the result for 2023 of R$ 825 million.  The  variations  stem  largely  from:  (i)  the  growth  of  R$  104  million  (12.5%)  in  the  remuneration  of  the concession assets due in large part to the increase in inflation; and (ii) the positive effect of R$ 28 million (311.1%) in the variation of the net result from construction revenues and costs (a growth of R$ 263 million and R$ 235 million, respectively), arising mainly from progress of work at the Asa Branca Transmission System.\nIn addition, during 2024, an amount of R$ 25 million was booked to the other operational expenses/revenues group with a positive effect on the result counterbalanced against the contract asset. This result is based mainly on the expectation of the executed revision in the investment structure and the capital remuneration rate, in turn resulting in modifications in the values of future RAP. In the light of the revision, the balance of the contract asset has been adjusted to incorporate the new financial flow. Conversely in 2023, an amount of R$ 64 million was booked to the other operational expenses/revenues group with a negative impact on the result reflecting the periodic tariff review when set against the contract asset as a counterbalancing item. This was based on Official CVM Circular 04/2020 and Aneel Ratifying Resolution 3,216 of July 04, 2023 due to a reduction in NTN-B and calculated on the basis of the composition of debt already issued and on interest rates implicit in secondary market quotations over the past 5 years. Given this revision, the balance of the contracted asset is adjusted to take into account the new financial flow.\nRAP value, net of PIS and Cofins, received in 2024, was R$ 742 million, (R$ 695 million in 2023), R$ 656 million (R$ 628 million in 2023) corresponding to the amortization of the contracted asset booked as a compensating item to the contracted asset, and R$ 86 million (R$ 67 million in 2023) relative to revenue from O&M services rendered.\nBelow is the composition of regulatory transmission Ebitda:\nRAP, net of PIS and Cofins, 2024 = 742. RAP, net of PIS and Cofins, 2023 = 695. RAP, net of PIS and Cofins, Chg. = 47. Operational costs, 2024 = (70). Operational costs, 2023 = (71). Operational costs, Chg. = 1.

  "The Company operates in the trading market of physical energy in order to generate results through energy price variations, within preestablished limits of risk. Energy trading operations are transacted in an active market and for accounting purposes, are defined as financial instruments according to their fair value. This is principally due to the fact that there is no commitment to match purchase and sale operations, flexibility being permitted to manage the contracts and obtain results through price variations in the market.\nGross result in 2024 was R$ 7 million negative, a decrease of R$ 11 million when compared to a positive R$ 4 million in 2023, substantially due to the negative impact of R$ 16 million in executed energy purchase and sale transactions. This effect was partially reduced thanks to the positive effect of a mark to market of R$ 5 million. Short-term  operations  are  classified  as  energy  purchase  or  sale  operations,  the  principal  objective  being  the management of the Company's exposure on the CCEE. Consequently, the price of these operations is characterized by the linkage with the Price for Settlement of Differences (PLD). This item also includes the transactions conducted through the CCEE, given their volatile and seasonal nature, therefore, short-term, of the results originating from accounting movement in the CCEE. Additionally, the long and short positions are settled at the PLD, thus, similar to the short-term operations described above.\nIn  relation  to  the  transactions  conducted  through  the  CCEE,  the  various  monthly  credit  or  debit  entries  to  the account of a Board agent are summarized in a single billing as a receivable or a payable. This therefore requires an entry to either an income or an expense item. In this context, it is worth pointing out that due to adjustments in the Company's portfolio management strategy, changes have been taking place in the profile of the mentioned billings. Such fluctuations complicate the direct comparison of the elements comprising each billing for the periods being analyzed - the reason for including this specific topic. The strategy allows us to analyze the fluctuations of the principal elements involved in spite of allocation  being  either  to  an  income  or expenses account according to the credit or debit nature of the billing to which they relate.\nNet Result of Short-Term Operations - (in R$ million)\nGenerically,  these  elements  are  revenues or  expenses  arising,  for  example,  (i)  from the application of the Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE); (ii) from the Generation Scaling Factor (GSF), triggered when generation  of  plants,  part  of  the  MRE,  is smaller or greater (Secondary Energy) than the allocated energy; (iii) from the so-called 'submarket risk'; (iv) dispatch driven by the Risk Aversion Curve (CAR); (v) the application of System Service Charges (ESS), resulting in dispatch which diverges from the thermal plants order of merit; and\n2024, Generation = 2024. 2024, Trading = 2024. 2024, Consolidated = 2024.

  "These variations were fundamentally  a consequence of the combination of the following positive factors: (i) an increase in  free market energy due to the strategy of allocating seasonalized energy in agreed periods relative to the positive variation in  PLD; and (ii) despite the reduction in hydropower generation of participating plants in the MRE, the Company  posted an increase  in hydropower production from the plants in its portfolio between compared years translating into a greater participation in the MRE and  a consequent positive effect through the intermediary of increased TEO (Energy Optimization Tariffs).\nThese factors were attenuated by the following negative effects: (iii) negative impact due  to the reduction from 89.7% in 2023 to 87.1% in calendar 2024 in the MRE Adjustment Factor (GSF) in view of the allocation of a physical guarantee and generation  of participating  plants;  and  (iv)  )  reductions  in  month-end  operations,  rebooking  and modulations between the years analyzed.\nSouth, 2023 = 72.17.

The  table  shows  average  PLD  values  for  the submarkets  in  which  the  Company  operates  in MWh.",
  "The Company reported an increase in sales, general and administrative expenses of R$ 76 million between 2024 and 2023. The key variations in the years under analysis, a function of the generation segment, in the amount of R$ 58 million respectively, is due largely to the following events: (i) the increase in general IT services; (ii) the increase in labor expenses due to the annual adjustment in employee salaries and benefits as well as new hiring between the quarters and years under review; and (iii) the acquisition costs of the Photovoltaic Complexes, with the related engagement of advisory services. In 2024, the Company booked an amount of R$ 57 million with respect to the writing off of assets in the generation segment, R$ 45 million of which relative to the Paracatu Photovoltaic Complex, due to a wind-related event in the region in April 2023.\nIn addition, R$ 25 million was booked to the operational expenses/revenues group with respect to the transmission segment with a positive effect on the result and counterbalancing the contract asset, more details being described under the specific Transmission Segment item.\nAt the end of 2023 the Company booked R$ 45 million to the generation segment by way of an indemnification for an  insurance  claim  for  damages  at  the  Paracatu  Photovoltaic  Complex  and  registered  under  other  operational revenues. Additionally, R$ 64 million was booked to the transmission segment with a negative effect on the result with respect to the periodic tariff review counterbalanced against the contract asset.

This reversal was the result of the writing off of assets, subsequently reimbursed by the insurance company. It is worth noting that the writing off of assets, together with reimbursement from the insurer, had no effect on the Company's results.\nIn 2023, the Company reported reversals of R$ 1,243 million of impairment due to the sale of the Pampa Sul TPP subsidiary and the amount of R$ 45 million of a provision for a reduction in the recovered value (net of the reversal booked in 2023), with respect to the insurance claim on behalf of the Paracatu Photovoltaic Complex.",

Regarding the stability of debt interest, this fact was the result of the increase in capitalization in fixed assets, mentioned above, from R$219 million in 2023 to R$463 million in 2024, representing a growth of R$244 million (111.4%).\nConcession expenses payable (Use of a Public Asset): On a 2023 x 2024 basis, there was a growth of R$ 156 million, or 26.0%, from R$ 599 million in 2023 to R$ 755 million in 2024, mainly a result of the increase of R$ 152 million in monetary restatement, again largely driven by the increases in IPCA and IGPM between the years.",
  "For the full year, these expenses increased by R$ 435 million (44.9%) from R$ 968 million in 2023 to R$ 1,403 million in 2024. The variation was largely a function of the increase in pre-tax (IR and CSLL) profit between the periods analyzed. Excluding non-recurring effects, IR and CSLL overheads fell R$ 14 million (1.5%), between years under review. Net income increased from R$ 3,429 million in 2023 to R$ 4,303 million in 2024, that is  an  increase  of  R$  874  million  or  25.5%. This  increase  is  a  combination  of  the following factors: (i) variation of non-recurring effects with a net positive impact of R$ 923 million; (ii) an increase of R$ 97 million in adjusted Ebitda; (iii) a reduction of R$ 14 million  in  IR  and  CSLL,  considering  recurring  transactions;  attenuated  by  the  (iv) increase of R$ 147 million in depreciation and amortization; and by (v) a negative effect of R$ 13 million in the net financial result. Excluding non-recurring effects, acquisition costs of subsidiaries, reversal of impairment net, divestment of a subsidiary, sale of a corporate stake in a jointly controlled subsidiary (TAG) and an insurance indemnity, net income fell by R$ 49 million (1.4%) between 2023 and 2024.",

The average debt maturity at the end of the year was 7.6 years.\nThe variation in company debt is related principally to a combination of the following factors in the full year 2024:\n(i) an additional R$ 1,209 million with the acquisition of subsidiaries; (ii) R$ 1,089 million in drawdowns from the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES), Banco  do  Nordeste  do  Brasil  (BNB)  and  Banco  da  Amazônia  (BASA),  for  the construction of new projects; (iii) R$ 2,928 million from the Company's 12 th   and 13 th debenture issues; (vi) generation of R$ 2,151 million in charges incurred to be paid and monetary restatement; and (v) R$ 3,840 million in amortization of loans, financing,  debentures and preference shares.\nThe average weighted nominal cost of debt at the end of the year was 10.5% equivalent to IPCA + 5.4% - 0.4 p.p. higher than recorded at the end of the 2023 (10.1% - equivalent to IPCA + 5.3%).\nOn  December  31,  2024,  the  Company's net  debt (total  debt  less  result  of derivatives operations, deposits earmarked to the guarantee of debt servicing and cash and cash equivalents) was R$ 20,126 million, an increase of 31.2% compared with the end of 2023 .",

  "The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operation 'Itasa' are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in proportion to the Company's interest. The Company also holds interests in consortia (joint operations in entities without legal personality), which are described in the table above, except for Consórcio Machadinho, in which  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia  holds  a  direct  interest,  for  which  the  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  are recognized directly in the financial statements of the consortium member, based on their respective interests in the consortia.\nIndirect subsidiaries Ibitiúva, Lar do Sol and Maracanã are fully consolidated. The non-controlling interest in their capital  stock  is  presented  separately  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  income  statements.  For  more information, see Note 9 -Investments, sub-item b.1.1 -non-controlling shareholders.\nAdditionally, on 12.31.2024 the Company held a 17.5% stake in joint venture TAG. For more information, see Note 9 -Investments.\nWhen the Company loses control over a subsidiary, the corresponding assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are written off at their book value as of the date on which control is lost. The Company's relevant accounting practices are presented in the notes specific to the items to which they refer. Critical accounting practices are those that are important to the reporting of financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management, often as a result of the need to make estimates that impact matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions that affect the possible future resolution of these uncertainties increases, these judgments become even more subjective and complex.\nIn preparing its financial statements, the Company has adopted certain assumptions based on historical experience and other factors that it considers reasonable and relevant. Although these estimates and assumptions are reviewed by the Company in the ordinary course of business, the statement of its financial condition and results of operations frequently requires the use of judgments regarding the effects of inherently uncertain matters on the book value of its assets and liabilities.\nActual results may differ from those estimated due to different variables, assumptions or conditions. In order to provide an understanding of how the Company forms its judgments about future events, including the variables and assumptions  used  in  the  estimates,  comments  have  been  included  regarding  each  critical  accounting  practice described below. The main notes related to the application of critical accounting practices and judgments are:\nDetermination of fair values of derivative financial instruments, Note = 13 and 14. Determination of the useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, Note = 10 and 11. Impairment test for long-lived assets, Note = 10 and 11. Contract asset construction margin, Note = 7. Recoverability of deferred income tax and social contributions, Note = 18. Discount rate applied to retirement benefit liabilities, Note = 16. Discount rate applied to the concession financial asset, Note = 6. Discount rate applied to concessions payable (Use of Public Asset), Note = 15. Electricity purchase and sale transactions in the short-term market, Note = 22 and 23. Provisions for tax, civil and labor risks, Note = 17. Provision for demobilization of generation assets, Note = 17",
  "Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value in the financial statements. Determining the fair value of the Company's derivatives requires the use of valuation methodologies that can be complex and involve the use of future estimates of exchange rates, inflation, long-term interest rates and energy prices. The Company recognizes depreciation of its property, plant and equipment based on annual rates established by the Aneel, which are used by companies in the Brazilian electricity sector and represent the estimated useful lives of the assets. Initial investments in generation assets whose plants have a public service concession are depreciated based on the useful lives defined by the Aneel, limited to the concession period of the plants. However, the actual useful lives may vary based on the technological update of the assets of each generating unit. The useful lives of property, plant and equipment also affect the impairment tests of these assets, when necessary. There are specific rules for assessing the impairment of long-lived and indefinite-life assets, especially property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investments. At the end of the year, the Company conducts an analysis to assess whether there is evidence that the value of long-lived and indefinite-life assets may not be recoverable. In unusual situations, if such evidence is identified, the Company performs an impairment test on these assets. These tests  involve  some  variables  and  uncertainties  regarding  cash  flow  projections  for  assessing  assets  in  use  and defining the market values of assets for those intended for sale. The projection of the realization of deferred tax credits recorded in non-current assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences is based on the realization period of each item contained in deferred assets and liabilities, tax loss and negative base, based on projections of future results.\nThe criteria used to realize each item are related to the predictability of realization of the principal amount that originated the temporary difference. When the expectation of realization of the item is difficult to predict, mainly because  it  is  not  with in  the  Company's  control,  such  as  provisions  for  litigation,  the  Company  uses  historical realization  to  project  its  future  realization.  The  realization  of  tax  loss  and  negative  base  amounts  follows  the possibilities of offsetting considering future profits and the limit established by law.",
  "The Company recognizes its obligations under employee benefit plans and related costs, net of plan assets, adopting the following practices: (i) future commitments arising from pension benefit plans are discounted to present value based on interest rates on federal government bonds with an average duration similar to that expected for payment of projected future commitments; and (ii) pension plan assets are measured at their fair values as of the balance sheet date.\nIn actuarial calculations, actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as mortality tables, inflation estimates, salary growth forecasts, dismissals and turnover.\nThe actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ from actual results due to changes in economic and market conditions, regulatory events, court decisions or shorter or longer life spans of participants. However, the Company and its actuaries used assumptions consistent with the internal and external analyses performed to define the estimates. Records of energy purchase and sale transactions in the short-term market are recognized on an accrual basis based on data published by the CCEE, which are determined by the product of energy surpluses or deficits recorded in a given month, by the corresponding PLD or, when this information is not available in a timely manner, by an estimate prepared by the Company.",
  "- Provisions for civil, tax and labor risks\nThe Company is a party to several judicial and administrative proceedings, for which provisions are recorded when an  outflow  of  funds  to  settle  the  contingency  is  probable  and  a  reasonable  estimate  can  be  made.  Significant contingent liabilities assessed as having a possible or remote risk are not provisioned. When relevant, proceedings assessed as having a possible risk are disclosed in the notes.\nThe probability of outflow of funds is based on risk assessment and qualification. This assessment is supported by the judgment and experience of Management, together with its legal advisors, considering case law, decisions in lower and higher courts, the history of settlements and decisions, if any, as well as other applicable aspects. Risk assessments and estimated amounts may differ from those that may be incurred by the Company.\n- Provision for demobilization of generation assets\nThe costs of decommissioning generation assets are provisioned based on estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and the present value of the expected costs for decommissioning and removing the assets at the end of the plant authorization period and are recognized against the costs of the corresponding asset. The provision is reviewed annually and any adjustments to the estimate are made against the cost of the asset.

  "Concession contracts define the public electricity transmission service as the service provided through construction (infrastructure  implementation)  and  O&M of transmission  facilities.  Based  on  this,  the  performance  obligations contained in these concession contracts were defined, namely: (i) construction and improvements; and (ii)  O&M. Accordingly, the Company allocates the revenue from these contracts to each of these performance obligations, considering the estimated costs for each of them, plus a profit margin.\nThe transmission contract asset is recorded against the revenue from the construction of transmission infrastructure throughout the execution of the work to implement the transmission system. The receipt of the consideration linked to the contract asset occurs through the receipt of the RAP allocated to the performance obligation for construction and improvements and depends on the completion of the implementation work and subsequent operation and maintenance of such infrastructure. The contract assets are remunerated by the remuneration rate and the IPCA variation.\nThe recognition of revenue from the construction of transmission infrastructure considers the costs actually incurred in the work, increased by the construction margin determined for the project, with gains or losses (efficiencies or inefficiencies in construction) being identified throughout the construction phase and recorded when incurred, in a timely manner, in a cost line item.\nThe construction margin is calculated by dividing the amount planned for 'management and/or monitoring of the work' in relation to the 'Project CAPEX ', both defined in the respective business plans. The proposed margins, net of applicable charges, are sufficient to cover the construction management costs.\nAdditionally,  in  the  initial  measurement  of  the  contract  asset,  the  Company  estimates,  when  applicable,  the application of the mechanism called 'Variable Portion' on the RAP to be received. This mechanism allows the RAP to be increased or reduced as a result of the performance of the transmission system. -\nNovo Estado, Consolidated.12.31.2024.Current = 356,719.

Due to the review, the balance of the contractual asset was adjusted to consider the new estimate of cash flow. As a result, a gain of R$ 2 5,341 was recorded in the Company's consolidated statements. During the construction and energization of the project, positive or negative impacts are expected due to events such as: (i) delays and additional costs due to environmental issues; (ii) variation in commodity costs, since cables and structures are purchased directly by the Company; (iii) additional costs of easements and land negotiations; (iv) possible unforeseen earthmoving events; and (v) early energization deadlines. Changes to the project that affect its profitability should be recognized directly in the income statement.\nIn the current year, the Company recognized a net loss due to inefficiency in the implementation of transmission infrastructure of R$ 3,231 (in 2023, a loss of was recognized in the amount of R$ 538). The recognized loss was substantially  driven  by  the  increase  in  construction  costs  expected  for  the  implementation  of  the  Transmission Systems, as well as the postponement of the entry into commercial operation of each stage of the projects.",

  "(3) For more information, see Note 18 -Taxes and other regulatory obligations, items a) and c). During 2024, the Company received R$ 1,789 from the sale of ENGIE Geração Solar Distribuída (EGSD) on February 21, 2022. The variation of R$ 17,000 between the years is substantially due to interest and inflation adjustment from the sale of subsidiary Pampa Sul, for which the expected receipt of the amount presented in non-current assets is in 2027, the deadline established in SPA. In December 2015, the Aneel approved the agreement to renegotiate the hydrological risk related to the Company's plants whose energy was sold in the ACR. As a condition for joining the agreement, the Company formalized the withdrawal of any legal dispute with the  Aneel that prevented the direct  application  of the physical  guarantee reduction mechanism, called GSF.\nThe  renegotiation  rules  established  options  for  choosing  the  level  of  hydrological  risk  to  be  assumed  by  the generators who, in return, assumed the commitment to pay a risk premium defined by the Aneel throughout the term of the energy sale contract in the ACR. Based on the new risk level defined in the terms of the renegotiation, the GS F corresponding to the year 2015 was recalculated, resulting in a payment surplus in relation to the amount determined, the amount of which has been offset against the 'risk premiums' owed by the Company, calculated at present value. Accounting practice: Investments in subsidiaries are those in which the Company is exposed or has the right to variable returns arising from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to interfere in these returns through the power it exercises over it.\nThese investments are measured using the equity method in the financial statements of the parent company and fully consolidated for the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements. The Company has joint operations in Itasa and in consortia. The interest in the joint operation in entities with legal personality, as is the case with Itasa, is recognized by the equity method in the parent company. In the consolidated statements, the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the aforementioned joint operation are recognized in proportion to the interest in the business. In the case of interests in consortia (entities without legal personality), the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recognized directly in the financial statements of the consortium member, based on the respective interests in the consortia.",
  "The Company holds an interest in a joint venture related to shared control of TAG. The investment in a joint venture is initially recorded at cost and subsequently recognized using the equity method. The results of a joint venture are recognized in the 'Equity method' line item in the individual and consolidated income statement, while changes in other comprehensive income are presented as part of the Company's other comprehensive income.\nThe  Company  assesses  annually  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  the  investment  in  a  joint  venture  has suffered an impairment loss, which is the result of the difference between the recoverable amount of the joint venture and its book value. Goodwill related to a joint venture is included in the book value of the investment and is therefore not amortized. Additionally, the  Company,  regardless  of whether or not there is any indication of impairment of goodwill, performs an annual impairment test, comparing its book value with the recoverable amount. In the parent company, the difference between the amount paid and the book value of the shareholders' equity of the acquired companies is recognized in the investment as: (i) surplus value, when the economic basis is substantially related to the fair value of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary; and (ii) goodwill, when the amount paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets and this difference represents the expectation of future value generation.\nBusiness combination is the method used to recognize acquisitions of control in the consolidated financial statements. This method requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value. Goodwill  arising  from  the  business  combination,  which  is  recorded  in  intangible  assets,  is  tested  annually  for impairment.\n(1) For more information, see item \"e.3\" of this note.",

  "On 06.28.2024, after fulfilling the conditions precedent, the sale of the equity interest that the Company held in subsidiary Lages Bioenergética Ltda. ('Lages') was completed. On that date, the company ceased to be controlled by the Company and was also no longer consolidated. The closing selling price was R$ 25,795, while the write-off of investment due to the sale of equity interest in a subsidiary totaled R$ 34,975, which generated a negative result from the sale of the asset, net of sales costs, of R$ 9,180. Accounting practice: The assets that make up property, plant and equipment are recorded at acquisition or construction cost. Interest and other financial charges on debt instruments related to construction in progress are computed as the cost of the respective property, plant and equipment asset, as are cash flow hedge gains and losses that qualify in relation to property, plant and equipment. The present value of the expected cost of decommissioning an asset after its use, when applicable, is included in the cost of the respective asset.\n%\nThe  costs  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  deducted  from  accumulated  depreciation  and  provisions  for impairment, when applicable.\nThe assets or set of assets that had accounting values substantially different from their fair values as of the date of adoption of the new accounting practices in Brazil, on 01.01.2009, began to have their fair value as cost attributed to the asset.\nComponents of certain  assets  that  are  replaced  periodically  over  the  useful  life  of  the  asset  are  recognized  as separate assets and depreciated over the period expected for their replacement. Costs of minor periodic and routine maintenance are recognized in income when incurred.\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized the fair values of intangible assets arising from concession rights or authorization for the use of public asset, acquired in a business combination, as a single asset in the property, plant and equipment group. This procedure was adopted because these intangible assets and property, plant and equipment items cannot be sold or transferred separately and because of the similarity between the terms of effectiveness of these rights and the useful lives of the assets.",
  "Depreciation of assets in full operation is calculated using the straight-line method based on annual rates established by the Aneel, which are used by companies in the Brazilian electricity sector and represent the estimated useful life of the assets, except for initial investments in generation assets, whose plants have a public service concession. These investments are depreciated based on the useful lives defined by the Aneel, limited to the term of the plant concession.\nThe residual value and useful life of assets and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and adjusted prospectively, when applicable. The Company assesses, at least annually, its property, plant and equipment items in order to identify evidence that may lead to impairment of the respective cash-generating units, or even when significant events or changes indicate that  their  book  values  may  not  be  recoverable.  If  it  is  identified  that  the  book  value  of  the  asset  exceeds  its recoverable amount, this provision for impairment is recognized in the income statement for the year.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair selling value, net of costs required to make the sale. The value in use corresponds to the discounted cash flows, before taxes, generated by the use of the asset during its useful life. Rights to use lease initially comprise the lease liability plus prepayments. These assets are depreciated based on the term  of  the  lease  agreements  and  assessed  for  impairment. Additionally,  they  are  adjusted  for  any  new remeasurement of the lease liabilities. Reservoirs, dams and  water mains, IMOBILIZADO  Average depreciation rate.3.7%  Parent  Company = 2.7%.

  "These are recorded at acquisition cost or at the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\nIn 2020 and 2021, the Company recognized intangible assets arising from the concession extension right, as a result of adhering to the renegotiation of hydrological risk in order to compensate the Company for costs incurred in the past, as provided for in Laws No. 14,052/2020 and 14,182/2021, at fair value, which is usually equivalent to the value defined and made available by the Aneel. This right was recognized when the right became virtually certain, against item 'Renegotiation of hydrological risk'. Additionally, in 2023, the Company recognized intangible assets related  to  the  displacement  of  the  days  of  extension  of  the GS F  (Generation Scaling Factor)  due  to  non-water impacts, in accordance with Law No. 13,360/2016.\nIntangible assets with a definite useful life are amortized using the straight-line method, based on commercial or concession and authorization contracts. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment. The Company assesses intangible assets at least annually to identify evidence that may lead to impairment of the respective cash-generating units or intangible assets, or when significant events or changes indicate that their book values may not be recoverable. If it is identified that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, this provision for impairment is recognized in the income statement for the year.\nThe recoverable value of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair selling value, net of costs required to make the sale. The value in use corresponds to the discounted cash flows, before taxes, generated by the use of the asset during its useful life.

The Company does not  engage  in  speculative  financial  transactions  involving  derivatives  or  any  other  risky  instruments,  except  for energy trading transactions, which are described in item 'a.4' below.\nThe main market risks to which the Company is exposed are:",
  "This risk is related to the possibility that the Company may suffer losses due to fluctuations in interest rates and financial indices applied to its liabilities, resulting in effects on its financial expenses. The Company and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rates and floating indices related to variations in the TJLP, DI rate, IGP-M and IPCA.\nRegarding the risk of inflationary acceleration, all energy sale contracts in force have an inflation adjustment clause, with the application of IGP-M or IPCA, which represents a natural long-term hedge for debts and obligations indexed to inflation rates and/or linked to inflationary variations, such as debts linked to the CDI.\nRegarding the risk of floating interest rates, part of the debt contracted is linked to the TJLP, which tends to fluctuate in line with fluctuations in interest rates and inflationary effects. Therefore, the contracted debts linked to the TJLP tend to be protected by the energy contracts mentioned above. It should be noted that, in contracts executed up to 12.31.2018, the amount corresponding to the portion of the TJLP that exceeds 6% p.a. is incorporated into the principal amount of the debt, a factor that mitigates the immediate impact on the Company's cash flow in the event of an acceleration of the TJLP. Since 01.01.2019, the Company has not entered into any contracts indexed to the TJLP. Exchange rate risk is associated with the possibility of changes in exchange rates, which affect the financial result and balances indexed to a foreign currency. The Company's exchange rate risk hedging policy seeks to achieve a low level  of  exchange  rate  exposure  in  its  liabilities  and  commitments  designated  in  foreign  currency,  which  are permanently monitored by its Financial Forum.

  "Derivative financial instruments are identified when: (i) their values are influenced by fluctuations in rates or prices; (ii) there is no initial investment; and (iii) they will be settled on a future date.\nThe derivative financial instruments held by the Company correspond to transactions to hedge exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks on debts and future commitments, which are recognized in accordance with the rules established  for  hedge  accounting,  as  mentioned  below.  In  addition,  the  Company  carries  out  energy  trading transactions with the purpose of obtaining results arising from market price variations.\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized as assets and/or liabilities in the balance sheet and measured initially and subsequently at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in their fair value are recognized in income, except when the derivative is qualified and designated for hedge accounting. At the inception of a hedge transaction, formal documentation is prepared describing the goals and strategies for managing  the  risk  covered,  and  the  relationship  between  the  transaction  underlying  the  hedge  and  the  hedge instrument used for the expected protection.\nThe Company's hedge transactions that qualify for hedge accounting are as follows: Hedge transactions to protect against exchange rate variations and floating interest rates on the Company's loans and debentures result from liability positions linked to the variation of the IPCA or CDI, i.e. non-fixed components, and are therefore referred to as 'fair value hedge'. In these transactions, gains or losses resulting from variations in the fair value measurements of loans and debentures and from hedging  transactions are recognized in financial income. The  Company  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges:  (i)  hedge  to  protect  foreign  currency  exposure  of  financial commitments for the acquisition of assets and loans; and (ii) hedge to protect aggregate exposure of loans abroad and fair value hedge, exchanging the short position for fixed components (fixed rate). In these transactions, for the highly effective portion of the hedge, gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the instrument are recognized in shareholders' equity under 'Other comprehensive income' and transferred to income or assets when the hedged object is effectively realized. The ineffective portion of the hedge, when it occurs, is recorded in financial income, together with the interest and exchange rate variations of the transaction, and capitalized in property, plant and equipment, when applicable.\n(i) Hedge transactions on loans and debentures As of 12.31.2024, the values of loans, debentures and derivatives measured at amortized cost and fair value are as follows:",

Therefore, the 25 th percentile (P25) and the 75 th percentile (P75) determine the 25% and 75% lowest prices observed, respectively.\nThe sensitivity analyses considering this methodology are presented below:",

  "The Company has loan, financing and debenture agreements with covenants, normally applicable to transactions of this nature, related to the achievement of financial performance indicators. If the Company fails to comply with any of these clauses, the debts may have their respective maturities accelerated. For more information, see Note 14 -Debt instruments. The transactions  relevant  to  the  Company's  business  that  are  exposed  to  credit  risk  are  energy  sales,  financial investments and hedge transactions. The Company has virtually no history of losses due to difficulties faced by banks and customers in honoring their commitments. The Company acts as a guarantor in financing agreements of its subsidiaries in order to ensure compliance with the commitments assumed. In long-term contracts executed with distributors, the Company minimizes its credit risk by using a mechanism for establishing guarantees provided for in the contracts themselves, which involve receivables from its customers, the management of which is carried out by a previously defined financial institution.\nIn order to minimize credit risk in electricity sales contracts in the ACL for free consumers, traders and generators, the  Company  requires  standard  guarantees  in  the  form  of  bank  guarantees  and  surety  bonds.  For  those counterparties that wish to present another form of guarantee, the Company, through its credit area, performs an analysis and establishes, in accordance with its Credit Policy, the guarantees that should be required from these counterparties.\nAll customers' credits are reviewed annually and their exposure to the various sectors of the economy is periodically assessed in order to maintain the diversification of their portfolio and reduce exposure to sector-specific risk.",

They must meet the following parameters: (i) shareholders' equity of at least R$ 1 billion; and (ii) rating of at least AA(S&P and Fitch) or Aa3 (Moody's) in the domestic scale.\nThe Company's available funds are allocated to an Exclusive Fixed Income Investment Fund, which has a policy of allocating its assets to very low-risk assets. As of 12.31.2024, this fund had 100% of its portfolio in assets with Brazilian Government credit risk, all with daily liquidity and post-fixed, linked to the variation of the Selic rate.\nIn  accordance  with  the  Company's  financial  planning,  the  assets  of  this  fund  will  be  used  in  the  short  term, substantially reducing the risk of any significant effects on its income, due to a possible reduction in the basic interest rate of the Brazilian economy. The  Investment  and  Derivatives  Policy  imposes  strong  restrictions  on  carrying  out  derivative  transactions  and determines continuous monitoring of exposures in the event of contracting such transactions.\nAs mentioned above, the main hedge transactions contracted by the Company were swaps and NDFs to protect against exchange rate and CDI variations. payments of principal and interest on loans contracted in US dollars and obligations with suppliers, as described in item a.2 -Risk related to liabilities denominated in foreign currency.",
  "The Company's liquidity risk management is the responsibility of the Financial Forum, which manages the short -, medium- and long-term funding and liquidity management needs through permanent monitoring of expected and actual cash flows.\nTo ensure its ability to pay its obligations, the Company uses a minimum cash policy, reviewed annually based on cash projections and monitored monthly at the Financial Forum meetings. The management of financial investments focuses on very short-term instruments, primarily with daily maturities, in order to promote maximum liquidity and meet disbursements.\nThe Company's cash -generating nature and the low volatility in receipts and payment obligations throughout the months of the year guarantee the Company stability in its cash flows, reducing its liquidity risk.\nThe statement below presents the expected settlement profile of the Company's main financial liabilities recorded as of 12.31.2024.

Energy supply in the SIN is mostly provided by hydroelectric power plants. Since the SIN operates under a dispatch system optimized and centralized by the ONS, each hydroelectric power plant, including those of the Company, is subject to variations in the hydrological conditions observed, both due to the conditions in the geographic region in which the plant operates and to the conditions in plants in other cascades which may influence the volume of water available for generation.\nThe  occurrence  of  unfavorable  hydrological  conditions,  together  with  the  obligation  to  deliver  the  physical guarantee, may result in the Company's exposure to the short -term energy market, which may affect its future financial results. However, almost all of the Company's hydroelectric generation capacity is included in the MRE, which operates as a 'condominium' in which the hydrological risk is shared among all the power plants participating in the Mechanism.\nIn order to further protect itself from hydrological risk, in December 2015, the Company joined the agreement to renegotiate the hydrological risk relating to power plants whose energy was traded in the ACR.\nAs of 12.31.2024, the physical guarantee of the hydroelectric plants held by the Company totaled 3,242.0 average MW. In the aforementioned agreement, 1,344.5 average MW were renegotiated, of which 1,243.7 average MW, or approximately 92.5%, are protected from hydrological risk. The portion of the Jaguara and Miranda Hydroelectric Plants intended to meet Physical Guarantee Quotas -512.3 average MW -is guaranteed by the contractual rules established by the Granting Authority and is also shielded from this risk; see Note 6 -Concession financial asset.\nRegarding the impacts caused to the MRE due to non-hydrological reasons in the past, generators will be entitled to an extension of the term of the generation license concession in order to compensate for the losses perceived, under the terms of Laws No. 14,052/2020 and No. 14,182/2021. More details are presented in Note 11 -Intangible assets.\nIn order to reduce exposure to short-term market fluctuations, ENGIE Brasil Energia maintains a large part of its energy portfolio contracted in the long term. In the free market, the Company gradually sells the available energy, seeking attractive prices and also minimizing the risk of exposure to short-term prices (spot or PLD). Additionally, due to the constant occurrence of hydroelectric generation deficits in recent years, it was decided to leave a portion of  the  volume  of  commercial  capacity  uncontracted  in  the  short-term  market  and,  whenever  necessary  or appropriate, to purchase energy from third parties to replace its own resources.",

  "The Company measures some financial instruments and non-financial assets at fair value, i.e. at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a voluntary transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.\nTo calculate fair value, valuation techniques appropriate to the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available are used in order to minimize the use of unobservable data.\nAssets and liabilities whose fair values are measured and disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy described below:\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active or passive markets identical to those to which the Company may have access as of the measurement date;\n-  Level  2:  valuation  techniques  for  which  the  fair  value  measurement  is  obtained  directly  or  indirectly  through information other than quoted prices (level 1); and\n- Level 3: valuation techniques for which the information used in measuring fair value is not available in the market (unobservable). In transactions involving financial instruments, significant differences were only identified between the amounts presented in the balance sheet and the respective market values of the financial instruments presented below. These differences occur mainly because these instruments have long settlement terms and different costs in relation to the interest rates currently prevailing for similar contracts.\nIn  determining market values, future cash  flows  were used, discounted at rates  deemed appropriate for similar transactions.\nLoans and financing in local currency, Parent Company.12.31.2024.Accounting = 1,633,830.

The Company also maintains a CD Plan at PREVIG , called 'Prevflex', which was established in 2005. On the date of its establishment, ENGIE Brasil Energia employees were allowed to choose between remaining in the BD Plan or being transferred to Prevflex (CD).\nHowever, participants who met certain preconditions established when Prevflex was created were given the option of maintaining existing reserves on that date in the BD Plan and, from then on, making contributions directly to the CD Plan . This Plan was called ' BSPS ' and is closed to new members. However, if they chose to transfer their reserves directly to the CD Plan, they would be entitled to a special contribution, which was accepted by 94% of participants.",

  "The customer, when purchasing electricity from the Company in 2002 for industrialization (use in its production process)  at  its  establishment  located  in  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  understood  that  ICMS  should  not  be  levied  on  the transaction, in view of constitutional provisions (item \"b\" of item X of paragraph 2 of article 155 of the Federal Constitution) and legal provisions (articles 2, paragraph 1, item III, and 3, item III of Supplementary Law No. 87/1996) applied to the matter, and expressed its intention to challenge such tax.\nIn November 2005, the customer and the Company, the latter acting as a tax substitute, executed a liability and reimbursement agreement, in which the client expressly ratified and declared that it was solely responsible for any and all payments, debts and liabilities, including additions, charges or penalties, relating to the ICMS levied on the transaction  relating  to  the  interstate  acquisition  of  energy  from  the  Company,  undertaking  to  reimburse  the Company and hold it harmless from any amount it may have incurred.\nAfter inquiries by the customer and the Company with the State of Rio Grande do Sul Treasury Department, the state tax authority issued a tax assessment report establishing the tax credit. After the appropriate appeals were filed at the administrative level, the tax assessment report was granted.\nFor this reason, in  November 2007, an ordinary action was filed to discuss the Company's right not to subject interstate  energy  transactions  with  the  client  to  ICMS,  after  the  filing,  in  October  2007,  a  of  preparatory precautionary measure with a request for a preliminary injunction aiming to obtain a Certificate of Suspended Tax Liability for taxes administered by the Treasury Department, offering, for this purpose, assets as collateral in an amount sufficient to  guarantee the tax credit, also  requesting that the company's name  not be included in the CADIN/RS records.\nAs a guarantee for the tax credit referred to in the case, properties that are part of the customer's manufacturing unit in Rio Grande do Sul, with their respective civil constructions, improvements, machinery and equipment, were offered as collateral in the precautionary measure, having been appraised and accepted by the Court.\nSubsequently, in 2012, the State of Rio Grande do Sul filed a tax foreclosure action, and the conversion of the security  deposited  in  the  aforementioned  precautionary  measure  into  a  seizure  was  granted.  Thus,  the  tax enforcement action was suspended until the final trial of the ordinary action.\nAfter unfavorable decisions in previous courts, several appeals were filed with higher courts, also without success. In view of the successive unfavorable decisions, as well as the case law of the STJ, the counselors, the Company and the  customer  decided  to  reassess  the  risk  of  the  case  as  probable.  Immediately  afterwards,  an  agreement  was formalized to pay the debt to the State of Rio Grande do Sul, which is being promptly paid by the customer. It is worth  noting  that  such  procedure  and  liability  of  the  client  is  supported  by  the  aforementioned  liability  and reimbursement  agreement,  as  well  as  being  secured  by  its  property.  Therefore,  the  provision  and  the  right  to reimbursement,  recorded  under  the  ite m  'Right  to  reimbursement  of ICMS on  sales  of  electricity',  were simultaneously recognized and presented on a net basis in income.",

  "On 12.14.2018, a Tax Assessment notice was issued against the Company regarding the non-payment of PIS and Cofins taxes on the amounts transferred by Eletrobras as reimbursement of the cost assumed by the Company due to the purchase of fuels, owned by CCC/CDE , used in the generation of energy by thermal power plants from January 2014 to December 2016, with the main argument that the fund received from Eletrobras are essentially revenues to subsidize costs. Said reimbursements are based on the Government's incentive to purchase fossil fuels used in thermal power plants.\nAccording to Federal Law No. 10.438/02, the Government created a public fund called ' CDE '  to  promote  the competitiveness of plants that use mineral coal, thus limiting the scope of the previously existing public fund, or 'CCC,' to isolated systems.\nThe CDE public fund to which the tax assessment refers, is made up as follows: (i) the  distribution company, in its invoices, charges end consumers for the amounts related to electricity consumption bill on which PIS and Cofins are due, transferring these amounts to the body responsible for managing the CDE; (ii) generation companies that use fossil fuels purchase these fuels and store the physical inventories on behalf of the fund responsible for management, which  maintains  the  ownership  of  these  assets;  and  (iii)  the  fund  responsible  for  management  reimburses  the generation companies for the amounts related to the fuel consumed.\nBased on the CDE mechanism, on 01.15.2019, the Company, through its external advisors, filed a Voluntary Appeal to the tax assessment, in which it argues that: (i) the Company does not own the fuels; (ii) the reimbursement does not have the characteristics of a subsidy for costs, since it is financed by the final energy consumers and not by the Government; and (iii) the reimbursed amount does not increase the Company's revenue, with case law in superior courts determining that PIS and  Cofins taxes should only be levied on inflows that effectively increase wealth. Therefore, the Company understands that the reimbursements addressed in the tax assessment notice are not subject to PIS and Cofins.\nOn 01.24.2020, the Company was informed on the unfavorable decision on the Voluntary Appeal. Subsequently, the Company filed a Motion for Clarification against the adverse decision by CARF. On 11.21.2022, the Company filed a Special Appeal with the CSRF, which was denied on 12.29.2022. As a result of the denial, the Company filed, on 01.09.2023, an Appeal with the CSRF, but this was also denied, ending the possibilities through administrative means. On 12.19.2023, the Company filed the corresponding lawsuit, which is pending in the Federal Court. We were summoned regarding the Tax Enforcement and requested its suspension due to the guarantee presented in the action for annulment, as well that it be treated as an embargo. On 10.15.2024, a decision was issued accepting the guarantee presented. In the records of the action for annulment, an unfavorable judgment was issued, against which an appeal was filed, which is awaiting judgment.\nFinally,  the  position  of  the  Company  and  its  lawyers  is  that  the  evolution  of  the  case,  even  if  the  outcome  is unfavorable in the administrative sphere, it will not change the assessment of a favorable outcome, that is, the Company understands that it has solid arguments to extinguish this undue collection of PIS and Cofins in the judicial sphere. In 2024, the debt was included in the registry of overdue tax liabilities, being increased by 20% related to the legal charges of the Attorney General's Office of the National Treasury (PGFN), being judicially guaranteed. The updated amount on 12.31.2024 was R$ 804,700.\nIn 2023, the Company received a new tax assessment notice from CDE regarding PIS and Cofins contributions on coal reimbursements, this time for the period from February to August 2018, with an Objection being filed and awaiting judgment. The notice totals amounted to R$ 72,166 on 12.31.2024.",
  "These cases remain with the Company after the sale of the Diamante subsidiary, since, in the period under analysis, the Jorge Lacerda Thermal Complex was still part of the parent company's generation complex. In 2023, Diamante received a new tax assessment regarding PIS and COFINS contributions for the years 2019 and 2020, charging such taxes on the reimbursement of coal by CDE. An objection was filed, which was ruled against the Company on 03.26.2024. Due to the decision, a Voluntary Appeal was filed, which in November 2024 was dismissed by the Administrative Council of Tax Appeals (CARF), and a decision still pending. In view of the above, the company will file a special appeal with the Superior Administrative Chamber.  The total amount of the fine, updated on 12.31.2024, is R$ 317,884.\nAlso in 2023, Diamante was fined in a new tax assessment notice charging IRPJ/CSLL, which were calculated under the presumed income method, for the year 2018, due to the reimbursement of coal by CDE. An objection was filed and ruled  unfavorable to the company.  On 02.16.2024,  a Voluntary  Appeal  was filed. This appeal  was given  a favorable decision by the Administration Council of Tax Appeals (CARF) in November 2024. The publication of the decision  is  being  awaited.  The  Federal  Revenue  Service  will  probably  file  a  special  appeal  with  the  Superior Administrative Chamber. The total amount of the fine, updated on 12.31.2024, is R$ 285,615.\nAlthough Diamante is the company being assessed, during the periods under discussion it was still a subsidiary of the Company and the issues presented here are provided for in the sales agreement and remain under responsibility of the Company.",
  "On 06.23.2023, the company was notified by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service regarding the disallowance of offsetting PIS / Cofins credits calculated untimely. After inspection, the RFB disallowed these credits on the grounds that (i) the procedure for rectifying the declarations, which is necessary to set up the credits, was not followed; and (ii) such expenses would not be linked to the Company's activities. An objection against this notice was filed and dismissed. Subsequently, a voluntary appeal was filed, which is awaiting judgment. The mechanism called 'spontaneous confession' allows the payment of overdue taxes without application of a late payment fine, as long as it is made before any administrative procedure or inspection measure. Since the RFB accepts late payments without the corresponding late payment fine, the Company files administrative challenges and, when necessary, legal measures.

  "The Company recognizes revenue from the supply and provision of electricity at the fair value of consideration, through the delivery of electricity during a given period. The volume of energy delivered to the buyer is determined on a monthly basis. Control of the electricity is obtained when the Company transfers the electricity to the customer. Invoices are issued monthly and are usually paid within 30 days from their issuance.\nRevenue is recognized based on the energy sold and at prices specified in the supply and delivery agreements. The Company may sell the energy produced in two environments: (i) the ACL, where the electricity is traded based on the free negotiation of prices and conditions between the parties, through bilateral agreements; and (ii) the  ACR, where the electricity is sold to distributors. Energy trading operations take place in an active market and, for accounting measurement purposes, they meet the definition of 'financial instruments at fair value.'\nThe Company recognizes revenue when energy is delivered to customers at the fair value of the consideration.

For the energy sold in the ACR, HEPs Jaguara and Miranda receive, as part of the RAG , the portion related to the GAG,  which  is  intended  for  remunerating  operation  and  maintenance  services  at  the  Plants  and  avoid  the interruption of availability of the facilities. The Company recognizes revenue at the fair value of the consideration receivable monthly, to the extent that the performance obligation to keep the Plant operating is met.\nRevenue relating to the implementation of infrastructure for provision of electricity transmission services under the concession agreement is recognized as the expenses are incurred, increasing the estimated margin for each project. Revenue from operation and maintenance services is recognized when the services are provided by the Company. Revenue  from  construction  of  transmission  infrastructure  is  recognized  to  the  extent  that  all  performance obligations are met over time. This revenue corresponds to construction costs, plus a residual gross margin intended to cover construction management costs. These construction expenses are recognized in costs.\nThe margin is estimated taking into account the projected budget for construction costs and its possible efficiencies, considering the regulatory deadline for delivery of the work. Any revenues arising from early completion of the Transmission System are recognized in the income statement for the year of the effective commercial advance authorized by Aneel.\nThe table below presents the reconciliation between gross operating revenue and net operating revenue reported in the income statements.",

  "A 'business segment' is an identifiable component of the Company aimed at providing an individual product or service, or a group of related products or services, and which is subject to risks and benefits that can be differentiated from other business segments. The Company's operating segments reflect its management, and its organizational and results monitoring structures, as summarized below:\n· Generation: this is the Company's main business, and it includes the generation and sale of the electricity in the portfolio.\n· Transmission: the Company is primarily responsible for the construction and installation of the infrastructure related  to  the  transmission  concession  of  the  Gralha  Azul,  Novo  Estado,  Gavião  Real,  Asa  Branca  and  Graúna Transmission Systems, being exposed to the risks and benefits of this construction. The Annual Permitted Revenue (RAP) is received as from the start of commercial operations of the Transmission System. Therefore, the inflow of revenues  from  operational  activities  starts  from  this  moment  onwards.  The  Gralha  Azul  and  Novo  Estado Transmission Systems started full commercial operations on February 19 and 27, 2023 respectively. Additionally, on July 8, 2024, the Company completed the implementation of the Gavião Real Transmissora de Energia project, with  full  energization  of  its  substation,  as  stated  in  the  Terms  of  Release  (TLD)  issued  by  the  National  System Operator (ONS) on July 12, 2024.\n· Trading:  this  segment  aims  to  obtain  results  through  the  variation  in  energy  prices,  within  previously established risk limits. The activities of this segment are carried out by the subsidiary ENGIE Trading.\n· Gas transportation: the  Company  also operates in the gas markets through its jointly owned subsidiary 'TAG.'\nThe  amounts  reported  for  each  business  segment  result  from  the  aggregation  of  subsidiaries,  allocation  of transactions by segment, and business units defined within each segment, as well as the cancellation of transactions between segments.\nThe Company presents the information by segment in a manner consistent with the internal report provided to the main operational decision-making body, the Executive Board. Based on the internal report, the Executive Board assesses the performance of the various segments and decides on the allocation of funds to each of the identified business segments.\nThe Company's financial result and income tax are not allocated by segment, since Management manages the cash flow at the corporate level. The Executive Board is the primary manager of operations, and it does not use the balance sheet by segment to make decisions or to analyze the results of each segment. For this reason, the balance sheet is not presented by segment.\nThe Company regularly assesses the information by segment relating to the jointly controlled subsidiary 'TAG' based on its proportional share in revenues, income, assets and liabilities, in order to decide about the resources to be allocated  to  a  segment  and  to  assess  its  performance.  However,  the  Company's  equity  interest  in  the  jointly controlled  subsidiary  is  accounted  for  in  the  individual  and  consolidated  financial  statements  using  the  equity method.\nThe information by segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is presented in a consolidated manner in the tables below:",

  "In the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had operating revenues from energy supply in the amount of RS 4,605,289 thousand (parent company) and R$ 11,218,635 thousand (consolidated), as disclosed in note 22, in which includes R$ 4,534,344 (parent) and R$ 8,734,203 (consolidated) related to revenues from the supply and provision of electricity, as well as transactions in the short-term market and trading operations . Additionally , the Company recognized energy purchase costs in the amount of RS 1,152,537 (parent) and R$ 1,696,753 (consolidated); as disclosed in note 23 (a.1).\nRevenues are mainly from the supply of electricity to free consumers, electricity distributors; generators , and traders. The recognition of energy revenues and purchase costs is carried out when the control of the goods or services is transferred to the client for a value that reflects the compensation to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for these goods or services. Revenue is an important indicator of the performance of the Company and its Administration, which can create an incentive to recognize revenue before the postponement of cost recognition; especially in the period preceding the end of the year. Additionally , the revenue process also includes the measurement of revenue for electricity supplied but not billed to the customer; calculated on an estimated basis, until  December 31, 2024, using certain assumptions arising from energy purchase and sale contracts .\nThe monitoring of this subject was considered significant for our audit,  considering the risks that a revenue or cost will be recognized in a period different from that in which the transfer of risks and benefits to the client occurred and consequent fulfilment of the performance obligation; in addition t0 the volume and specificity in the measurement of the revenue and cost cut-off at the end of each reporting period.\nHow our audit addressed this matter\nOur audit procedures included, but are not limited to:\nEvaluation of the adequacy of accounting policies adopted by the Company, and understanding of internal controls related to the recognition of revenues and costs of supply of electricity;\nEvaluation of the reasonableness of the accounting estimates of energy revenue and cost, recognized at the end of the year;\n(iii) Analysis of a sample of contracts; to conference the data used in the measurement of the estimate;\nTesting of receipt and subsequent payment of invoices, by sampling; and\n(iv) Evaluation of the subsequent liquidation report issued by the Câmara de Comercialização de Energia Elétrica (Electric Energy Trading Chamber or CCEE), with the purpose of corroborating the volume of energy purchased and sold by the Company;\nAssessment of the adequacy of disclosures made by the Company on revenues and costs , included in notes 22 and 23 (a.1) to individual and consolidated financial statements .\nBased on the results of the audit procedures canied out on the revenue recognition and costs with energy purchase, which is consistent with the Company's assessment, we consider that the criteria and assumptions used are acceptable; as well as the respective disclosures; in the context of the individual and consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.",
  "As of December 31, 2024, the Company has provisions for civil, fiscal and labour risks in the amounts of RS 214,895 thousand (parent company) and RS 238,154 thousand (consolidated). Also, the Company has civil, fiscal and labour proceedings considered with a prognosis of possible and remote loss in the amounts of RS 1,765,903 and RS 762,775 thousand, respectively, in the parent company , and RS 1,848,631 thousand and RS 788,644 thousand in the consolidated entity; for which no provisions were recorded, as disclosed in note 17 .\nThis matter was considered relevant to our audit, since; in determining the amounts to be accounted for to face these risks , as well as the amounts of possible and remote risks disclosed in the individual and consolidated financial statements; the Company , advised by its legal advisors, applies judgment that requires the use of   technical and historical   knowledge;  the analysis of   jurisprudence and the individualised analysis of the cases.\nHow our audit addressed this matter\nOur audit procedures included, but are not limited to:\nTesting of the integrity and accuracy of the database used by the Company to develop estimates on the prognosis of losing cases;\nchallenge to the assumptions and judgments used by the Company in the development of these estimates , considering the involvement of experts in the evaluation of lawsuits; and\nIndependent confiration with external legal advisors and patrons of the proceedings regarding the classification of the risk of loss, the procedural phase and the amount involved;\n(iv) Evaluation of the adequacy of disclosures made by the Company on the provisions of disputes and processes considered with a possible and probable prognosis; according to note 17 to the individual and consolidated financial statements .\nBased on the results of the audit procedures carried out on the provision for civil, tax and labor risks , which is consistent with the Company's assessment, we consider that the criteria and assumptions used\nare acceptable, as well as the respective disclosures, in the context of the individual and consolidated financial statements taken as a whole-",
  "As described in note 9 (f), on March 6 , 2024, the Company completed the  acquisition of the Juazeiro; São Pedro, Sol do Futuro; Sertão Solar  and Lar do for the total consideration of RS 2,361 million-\nMonitoring this matter was considered significant for our audit; given the judgment exercised by the Company in the accounting treatment of this transaction as a business combination and in measuring the purchase price allocation.\nHow our audit addressed this matter\nOur audit procedures included, but are not limited to:\n(i) Reading of the contracts and investment agreements that supported the transaction; including the respective approvals by the Company's governance bodies;\n(iüi) Involvement of experts to analyze the projections and assumptions that support the measurement of the purchase price allocation; and\n(ii) Validation of the purchase price allocation calculation and the completeness and accuracy of the Prospective Financial Information (PFIs) used in its projection;\n(iv) Assessment of the appropriateness of the disclosures transaction and other impacts on the individual and consolidated financial statements .\nBased on the results of the audit procedures   carried out on the business combination;   which is consistent with the Company's assessment;, we consider that the criteria and assumptions used are acceptable, as well as the respective disclosures , in the context of the individual and consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.",

Additionally, the Company generated net cash from its operating activities of R$ 4,586 million in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023.\n· The Company's net debt as of December 31, 2022, was R$ 15,685 million and corresponds to 2.3 times the adjusted EBITDA due to impairment and disposal of subsidiary in 2022 of R$ 6,941 million. In addition, the Company reported a positive operating cash flow of R$ 3,338 million in 2022.\nBased on the results disclosed and in the Company's business plan, the Executive Officers have reinforced payment capacity in relation to the financial commitments assumed.\nFitch Ratings assigns a Long-Term National Rating to ENGIE Brasil Energia of 'AAA(bra)' with a stable outlook and on the global scale, 'BB(bra)', also with a stable outlook and one notch above sovereign rating. The ratings feed through directly  to  the  ability  to  raise  attractive  credit  lines,  thus  enhancing  competitiveness  in  the  development  of  new projects.",
  "The Company uses lines of credit from top-ranking financial institutions to cover any short- and medium-term cash needs.\nAs concerns the Company's investment projects, in addition to using some of its cash generation, the main source of financing is the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), either directly or through Banks that lend-on BNDES lines. In addition to the BNDES, the Company also uses other development banks such as Banco da Amazônia (BASA) and Banco do Nordeste (BNB). These institutions normally offer interest rates and terms of payment compatible with the return on energy generation projects.\nIf the investment project is not eligible for BNDES financing or due to financing-cost issues, the Company may use other  sources  of  incentivized  funding  such  as  the  Constitutional  Financing  Fund  for  the  Northeast  (FNE),  the Constitutional Financing for the Center-West (FCO), the capital markets through the issuance of promissory notes and/or debentures or other sources of funding, in order to maintain an adequate capital structure and liquidity. The Company constantly evaluates operations financing alternatives.\nIn 2023, the Company used resources from the BNDES and resources arising from the issuance of debentures.\nIn 2022, the Company used resources from the BNDES and BASA as its principal source of financing. Notwithstanding the fact that Management does not foresee any liquidity deficiency, the Company holds standby credit lines (working capital, long-term financing and bank guarantees) from first class financial institutions.\nIn the event that it should need to draw on financing for working capital, the Company intends as a priority to use credit lines available in the market from first class credit institutions. In the case of financing of non-current assets, the Company intends as a priority to use long-term financing resources directly from the BNDES or its Lend-On Banks.\nIn addition, because of the high rating assigned by ratings agency Fitch Ratings, the Company has ready access to the capital markets should it need to obtain additional funding.",

The issue took place on September 1, 2020. The shares give the right to participate in dividends declared and distributed by NEP on a priority and cumulative basis. As from the six months immediately following the entry into operations of the Transmission System, dividends will be allocated on a six-monthly basis, NEP not being obliged to distribute dividends prior to this event.\nThe number of redeemable preferred shares totals 95,446,379, subdivided into 12 classes, with different redemption terms, the redemption term of the last class being on October 31,2034.

Another early-maturity case occurs in the event of changes to effective direct or indirect control of the beneficiary of the credit without the bank's prior consent. In addition, other events affecting the project's op erating capacity, or the guarantees provided to the bank are ordinarily regarded as early-maturity cases.\nMoreover, more comprehensive items such as unappeasable sentencing in a case involving child labor, slave labor or crimes against the environment also imply early maturity of financial instruments of this type.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are compliant with the covenants as provided in its loan and financing agreements. The commitments are verified on an annual basis as established in these agreements, except for the Issuer's own contracts, which are calculated quarterly.",

This variation was mainly a reflection of the following factors:\n(i) a reduction of R$ 338 million (3.6%), mainly due to the following negative effects: (i.i) a decrease of R$ 343 million in  revenue  from  energy  sales  agreements  in  the  regulated  and  free  contracting  environments,  a  result  of  the combination of variations in the volume of energy sold and the net average selling price; and (i.ii) a reduction of R$ 17 million in the remuneration of concession financial assets corresponding to the portion of the payment for the grants of  the  Jaguara  and  Miranda  hydropower  plant  concessions  with  respect  to  power  allocated  to  the  Regulated Contracting Environment (ACR), reflecting a decrease in inflation between the analyzed years. These effects were partially  attenuated  by  the  (i.iii)  increase  of  R$  37  million  in  the  transactions  executed  in  the  short-term  market, principally conducted across the Electric Energy Trade Board (CCEE). In addition, occurred (ii) a decrease of R$ 568 million (33.4%) in the transmission segment, and (iii) a reduction of R$ 246 million in the trading segment (35.9%) as the result of reduction in revenue from executed operations. In 2023, the operational costs reached R$ 4,841 million, R$ 1,476 million lower (23.4%) than costs posted for 2022 of R$ 6,317 million. This variation was a reflection of the combination of the following elements: (i) a decrease of R$ 830 million (72.8%) in the costs of the transmission segment, in large part due to the reduction in construction costs; (ii) a decrease of R$ 409 million (9.1%) in the energy generation and sales from the portfolio segment; (iii) a reduction of R$ 234 million (35.0%) in the costs of energy trading operations; and (iv) a variation of R$ 3 million in the costs of sales and installation of solar panels in the light of the sale of EGSD.",
  "· Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses: The  Company  reported  increased  selling,  general  and administrative expenses of R$ 66 million between 2023 and 2022. The key variations reflect increase in the generation segment of R$ 62 million, largely impacted by the following events: (i) an increase in expenses with advertising and publicity in the light of the commercial strategy for capturing opportunities following the opening of the free energy market; and (ii) an increase in expenses with outsourced IT services, consultancies and legal fees.\n· Reversal (provision) for impairment, net: During 2023, the Company booked an amount of R$ 1,243 million of reversal impairment due to the disposal of the Pampa Sul TPP subsidiary and a provision of R$ 45 million of impairment, with respect to the incident at the Paracatu Photovoltaic Complex. In 2022, the Company (i) R$ 21 million impairment provision was booked relative to the increase in the costs of supply of raw materials to the Lages subsidiary; (ii) complemented the Pampa Sul TPP impairment of R$ 164 million; and (iii) reversed R$ 118 million with respect to EGSD, by virtue of the latter's sale on February 21, 2022 .\n· Disposal of a Subsidiary: Following the fulfillment of suspensive conditions, the disposal of the Company's corporate stake in the Pampa Sul TPP subsidiary was concluded on May 31, 2023. On this date, ceasing to be controlled by EBE and also no longer consolidated. The result of the sale of the asset, net of selling costs (a negative R$ 1,296 million) and reversal of the impairment (R$ 1,243 million), was negative at R$ 53 million in 2023. Additional to this operation, the Company reported sales revenue worth R$ 9 million, a reflection of an adjustment of the sale price of the Diamante subsidiary in 2021, the price adjustment related to the fulfillment of obligations conditioned to receipt. On February 21 and September 1, 2022, the sale of the Company's stakes in the EGSD and Norte Catarinense subsidiaries were concluded. On these dates, these corporations ceased to be controlled by the Company, as well as no longer being consolidated. The result of the disposal of EGSD, net of selling costs (R$ 94 million), and reversal of impairment (R$ 118 million), was a positive R$ 24 million. The result of the sale of Norte Catarinense, net of selling costs was positive at R$ 10 million.\n· Other operating (expenses) revenues, net: In 2023, the Company recognized the amount of R$ 45 million in the generation segment by way of an insurance claim following an incident at the Paracatu Photovoltaic Complex  and  registered  under  other  operational  revenues.  In  addition,  during  2023,  R$  64  million  was recognized in the transmission segment with a negative effect on the result relating to the periodic tariff review offset against the contractual asset.  In  2022,  the  amount  of  R$  20  million  was  recognized  in  the transmission  segment  and  reflecting  a  positive  adjustment  in  the  acquisition  price  of  the  Novo  Estado Transmissora  de  Energia.  This  adjustment  was  made  following  a  12-month  measurement  period  of  the combina tion of businesses, being booked to the Company's result. In addition to the effect mentioned in the transmission segment, again in 2022, a negative R$ 22 million was booked to the accounts with respect to the generation segment, largely the write-off of Pampa Sul assets in the light of maintenance undertaken in 2022.",
  "The equity income generated from the stake in TAG for the years 2023 and 2022 increased R$ 266 million (36.6%) from R$ 727 million to R$ 993 million, respectively. · Financial revenues: comparing the calendar years, financial revenues were down R$ 136 million (23.2%) from R$ 585 million in 2022 to R$ 449 million in 2023, principally in the light of lower income from financial investments of R$ 126 million. This reduction was mainly a reflection of lower average balances of financial investments between the years and a slight increase in CDI between the years under analysis.\n· Financial expenses: expenses fell from R$ 2,373 million in 2022 to R$ 1,813 million in 2023, or a reduction of R$ 560 million (23.6%), a combination largely of the following effects: (i) a decrease of R$ 527 million in debt between the years analyzed, of which: (i.i) a reduction in interest payments of R$ 404 million, principally in the form of settlement of debt instruments in significant amounts in the course of the year 2023; and (i.ii) a reduction of R$ 123 million of monetary restatement in the light of inflationary variation, attenuated by the increase in the outstanding balance of debt instruments.\n· Concession expenses payable (Use of Public Asset): When comparing calendar years, there was a reduction of R$ 128 million, that is 17,6%, from R$ 727 million in 2022 to R$ 599 million in 2023, the result of the following effects: (i) a reduction of R$ 155 million in monetary restatement, driven largely by the deceleration in IPCA and IGPM between the years, of especial note being the IGPM index for 2023 which posted deflation; and (ii) a R$ 27 million increase with the restatement of the present value of concessions payable.",
  "On the basis of a calendar year-on-year comparison, the amount of the Income Tax and Social Contribution (current and deferred), reported an increase of R$ 347 million (55.9%) from R$ 621 million in 2022 to R$ 968 million in 2023. Variations largely reflected the increase in pre-IR and -CSLL profit between the periods under review. As a result of the factors mentioned above, net income in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 was R$ 3,429 million, compared to R$ 2,665 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

The net increase of R$ 1,248 million between the fiscal years is due principally  to  (i)  an  increase  in  profit  before  adjusted  taxes;  (ii)  an  increase  in  construction  RAP  (Annual  Allowed Revenue); (iii) positive variation in other liabilities; and (iv) reduced payments of income tax and social contribution. Net  cash  consumed  from  investing  activities  was  R$  2,042  million  and  R$  1,784  million  in  fiscal  years  ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net reduction of R$ 258 million between the periods is due largely to (i) an increase in investments in fixed and intangible assets; and attenuated by (ii) a reduction in investments in acquisitions; and (iii) the increase in dividends received from jointly controlled subsidiaries. Net cash from financing activities was R$ 476 million of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. Net cash consumed by financing activities was R$ 4,474 in fiscal year ending 2022. The net increase of R$ 4,950 between fiscal years was largely due to (i) the increase in the issuance of debt instruments; (ii) the increase in the payment of debt instruments, net of hedge; and (iii) investment on the part of minority shareholders, net of issuance costs.

This variation was mainly a reflection of the following factors: Net average energy selling price, net of charges on revenue and trading operations, was R$ 226.42/MWh, 1.6% higher than in  2022, which was R$ 222,85/MWh. The increase in price between the periods under analysis was driven principally by the monetary restatement of current agreements, partially attenuated by the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary, which sold energy at prices above the average for the remainder of the Company's portfolio .\nEnergy sales volume in agreements, net of trading operations, was 35,816 GWh (4,088 average MW) in 2023, against 37,932 GWh (4,330 average MW) reported in 2022 - a decrease of 2,116 GWh (242 average MW) or 5.6%. The reduction in energy sales volume was driven by the reduction in distributor sales volume due to the sale of the Pampa Sul subsidiary and the lower purchase volume and consequently, lower volumes available for sale.\nReduction in sales volume and increase in average selling prices together translated into reductions of R$ 343 million between compared years, in the Company's net operating revenue - R$ 348 million, relate to the disposal of the Pampa Sul subsidiary in 2Q23.",
  "Increase of R$ 76 million (10.1%) in the remuneration of concession assets, caused, in particular, by the increase in the balances of contract assets and smoothed by the decrease in inflationary indices. The concession financial assets represent the present value of future cash flows from the portion of energy allocated to the Regulated Contracting Environment (ACR) of the Jaguara and Miranda hydropower plants, corresponding to 70% of the physical guarantee of these plants. These assets are remunerated at the internal rate of return and at the variation of the Amplified Consumer Price Index (IPCA). The remuneration of the financial assets fell from R$ 485 million in 2022 to R$ 468 million in 2023, a reduction of R$ 17 million (3.5%). The variation was substantially driven by the reduction in the IPCA between the respective years.

The Company's sales revenues are supported by agreements with price adjustment clauses indexed, for the most part, to the IPCA and the IGP-M. The Company's revenues are not exposed to exchange rates in a manner that significantly affects income and were not materially affected by the introduction of new products and services.\nIn energy trading operation, the Company operates as a means to derive income from electric energy price changes, within the risk and counterparty limits previously set by the Company's Management.\nThe main changes in the Company's revenues due to price modification and volume change are explained in item 2.2.a (i) above.",
  "c.1) inflation and price changes in the cost of electricity sold\nEnergy purchased for portfolio-management purposes: such transactions are usually conducted by means of mediumand long-term contracts with prices restated at IPCA and IGP-M. The average negative impacts of price restatements at the applicable inflation indices were R$ 68 million and R$ 25 million for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCharges for the use of the electricity network and connection: these are calculated by multiplying the amount of network usage in kW by the rate established annually by Aneel, based on the prorating of the total observed and expected  costs  of  connection  and  transmission  for  the  entire  system,  and  on  inflation  indices  for  readjusting transmission  and  existing  connection  agreements  -  IPCA  and  IGP-M.  The  effect  of  the  change  in  these  inflation indicators on the Company 's cost was R$ 17 million and R$ 51 million in fiscal years of 2023 e 2022, respectively.\nFinancial compensation for the use of water resources (royalties): The amount corresponds to 7.0% of the quantity of electricity produced, adjusted by an Annual Reference Tariff (TAR) defined by Aneel, based on the acquisition cost of energy by the distributor and subject to review every 4 years.\nIn fiscal year 2023, TAR recorded a variation of 7.2%, with negative impact in the Company's result of approximately R$ 16 million.

  "The  Company  offers  its  managers  a  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  (ILP)  sponsored  by  the  directly  controlling shareholder, ENGIE Brasil Participações Ltda. ('ENGIE Brasil Participações') . As described in items 8.1 and 8.8, the Company's directly controlling shareholder, ENGIE Brasil Participações, offers a Phantom Shares-based ILP to the Executive Board and certain members of the Board of Directors, in connection with medium- and long-term goals. The ILP is approved by the ENGIE Group's CEO, Catherine MacGregor, the last plan being approved in the middle of 2022. There is no maximum number of shares covered. The maximum number of Phantom Shares to be distributed corresponds to the maximum individual amount as described in item 'g', below, divided by the value of the shares. As described in item 'e', below, the amount of the ILP (% of the annual salary converted into Phantom Shares) is limited to 130% of the Company's compensation range for the executive's position plus the ILP set for the position in question on the granting date. The annual base salary plus adjusted ILP must not exceed this limit. The ILP is intended for the executives of the Company and of the directly controlling shareholder, ENGIE Brasil Participações, who maintain management agreements and positions with the companies' Executive Boards. The controlling shareholder will annually determine executives eligible for the ILP. The market value of the Phantom Shares is calculated as the simple average of the closing price of the EGIE3 stock in the three months preceding the grant date. Upon the plan's 3rd anniversary, the market value of the phantom shares (again, calculated as the average closing price of EGIE3 in the 3 months preceding the end of\nthe period) will be the basis for the reward to be paid for goals achieved. The ending date shall be the 15th of March subsequent to the plan's 3rd anniversary, after the previous fiscal year's accounts have been drawn and finalized.

No shares were granted relative to share-based compensation in the past 3 fiscal years. As of the date of presentation of this document, there were no shares earmarked for delivery directly to the beneficiaries of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. The LongTerm Incentive Plan ('ILP') is proposed annually by the directly controlling shareholder, ENGIE Brasil Participações Ltda., in the light of the following:\n· Each beneficiary's individual amount will be set as a percentage of the executive's annual base salary .\n· The amount of the 'ILP' shall be deducted of the nominal amount, on the date of the award of the performance shares plan of ENGIE S.A., granted in the previous year.\n· The resulting amount will be converted into a number of phantom shares based on the market value of the company's shares (EGIE3), providing the basis for the amount of the bonus to be paid for objectives attained by the date of the plan's maturity . Awarding of Phantom Shares considers the share's market value and is calculated as the simple average of the closing price of EGIE3 in the 3 months preceding the date of the award. The date of the award is that provided in the Performance Shares plan of the indirectly controlling shareholder, ENGIE S.A., and usually in December each year.",
  "For as long as the plan is in force, the number of shares assigned to determine the amount of the incentive may increase proportionally based on the share price when the company pays its shareholders dividends and interest on shareholders' equity. The rest atement is to be carried out by means of the calculation of the dividend yield of the closing price of EGIE3 on the relevant date.\nThe exact amount of the incentive will be calculated using the following formula: (% SB -average of the 3 last years VF PSP) / price of the EGIE3 share on the plan's starting date = X X Number of phantom shares (initial). For the final value of the shares consider: X Number of Phantom Shares x price of EGIE3 on the final date. And total payment will be the final value of the shares multiplied by the performance indicators. Where:\n· % SB is a % of the basic annual salary according to the executive's wage matrix on the plan's starting date;\n· VF PSP is the face value of the performance shares of ENGIE S.A. granted in the previous year, at the quoted price and EUR/BRL exchange rate on the granting date thereof.\n· Price of EGIE3 as discussed in letter 'a' of the present section The Group's share based ILP does not provide for early exercise . Not applicable to the Group's shares based ILP plan, as share volatility was not a factor in the calculations made to determine the amount of the bonus. The total payment under the ILP will be a percentage of the share value at the end of the cycle. This percentage will be determined by the results achieved in the plan's four performance indicators in the 3 -year period of the plan: ROCE (return on employed capital) of the ENGIE Group - 30%, Total Shareholder Return (total return for the shareholder) -25%, RNRPG (recurring net revenue) -25% and RSE (Corporate Social Responsibility) -20%.\nAt the end of the plan's 3 years, the market value of these shares (again calculated in the basis of the average closing price of EGIE3 in the 3 months prior to maturity date) will be based on the amount of the bonus to be paid for reaching the targets. The maturity date shall be on the March 15 following the 3rd year of the plan after the closing of the results for the preceding fiscal year.",

  "ADRIANA WAGNER: Hi and a good morning. We are now beginning the videoconference for the results of the fourth quarter of 2024 of ENGIE Brasil Energia. I am Adriana Wagner, the Company's Investor Relations Analyst. I would like to make a few announcements before beginning the video conference.\nCurrently, those who are connected are in listening mode only. Later, when we open the questions and answers session to participants, you may submit your questions via the Zoom Q&A tool. Please note that this video conference is being recorded.\nWe have also made available on our website www.engie.com.br/investidores the files for the Presentation and Results Release as well as the ITR and other documents filed yesterday at the CVM with more detailed analysis of the financial statements, operational results, ESG  indicators,  progress  made  with  the  implementation  of  new  projects,  among  other relevant factors in the period.\nBefore proceeding further, I would like to clarify that any statements that may be made during this videoconference with respect to the business outlook for the Company, should be treated as forecasts contingent on the economic scenario for the country, performance, and electric energy sector regulations as well as other variables and are therefore subject to change.\nWe would remind you that journalists wishing to ask questions should do so via e-mail, sending their questions to the Company's Press Relations office.\nWith  us  today  to  discuss  ENGIE  Brasil  Energia's  fourth  quarter  2024  performance  are Eduardo Takamori, Chief Financial and Investor Relations Officer and Rafael Bósio, Investor Relations Manager of the Company.\nI would like now to pass the floor to Takamori, to begin the presentation.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Good morning to all. It's a pleasure to be her e again with you. I begin with the highlights but before talking about these four elements we have included on the slide, I would like to recall that 2024 was an excellent year for ENGIE Brasil Energia. We reported some excellent results, a demonstration of the total resilience of our strategy and indicative of how our execution has worked very well -as everyone knows, in this super challenging context both domestically and globally.\nIn  the  first  block  here,  we  talk  about  the  entry  into  commercial  operations  of  some projects. Here we have the Serra do Assuruá Wind Complex, which had already reached 74% of its commercial operation by mid-February, while the Assú Sol Photovoltaic Complex was also operating already at 25% of its installed commercial capacity.\nYou are going to see the effect of this in the following slides which Rafa will be showing, but in short, we managed to put an additional 1.2 GW of installed capacity into commercial operation over the course of the year at an investment of R$ 9.6 bi, a reflection of our capacity both in acquiring projects already in operation, as well as showing our capacity to both acquire operational as well as to implement greenfield projects, with excellence.\nSee the way that both the Assuruá as well as Assú Sol are being completed on schedule -Assuruá  significantly  anticipating  its  construction  schedule -naturally  on  budget  and within the parameters of quality which we expect because we are long-term operators as well.\nThe second highlight which we include here in the upper right-hand corner, is gross energy production, which grew 24% in relation to 2023. This is very significant growth; we go into further detail on this amount in the following slides.\nAnd  as  everyone  knows,  curtailment  is  a  sensitive matter  in Brazil. It affected approximately 9% of wind and solar generation in 2024 but ended up being well diluted and neutralized by the generation of our hydropower portfolio and impacting only 1% of total portfolio generation.\nIn the lower, left-hand corner, we also highlight the fact that Fitch reaffirmed our national long-term rating at AAA. This is very important for maintaining funding efficiency. We are a company that seeks new projects with a certain frequency and naturally the financing makes a big difference for us in ensuring that we remain competitive.\nAnd finally in the lower right-hand corner we show that for the first time ENGIE Brasil Energia is a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets. In fact, this index has been given a new name since the beginning of the year -and is now called the",
  "Dow Jones Best-in-Class Emerging Markets, but it is better known as the DJSI, so we decided to keep the two names here. And we are now back in the Corporate Knights Global 100 ranking, which we shall explain a little later on as well.\nIn the next slide, we talk about the main numbers. On our adjusted Ebitda between the quarters,  in  the  fourth  quarter  there  was  a  very  important  addition,  an  increase  of practically 18% … a little more than 18% compared to the same quarter in 2023. And what we  highlight  here  is  the  accumulated  variation  of  12  months,  which  showed -in  the accumulated 12 months -an increase of almost 20%, a very significant increase. Naturally, an important part of this increase is the result of the partial divestment of the stake in TAG early on in 2024 amounting to R$ 1.3 bi.\nSo now, what are the main elements that have brought this adjusted EBITDA to this very interesting level? We had a greater contribution from the generation segment of R$ 155 million -we will be commenting further about this later on; transmission as well with a very significant additional contribution of R$ 221 million in relation to the previous year; and of course, when there is a partial divestment, there is a smaller contribution to equity income results --R$ 280 million approximately.\nWhen you come to the accumulated figure, you have an Ebitda contribution within the adjusted net income of about R$ 100 million, which can be found on the right-hand side of the slide. It's more or less the same shape: you have the fourth quarter with a result that exceeded R$1 billion in adjusted net profit.\nWhen  you  look  at  the  accumulated  adjusted  net  income  for  12  months,  you  come  to R$ 3.4 bi roughly without the effect of the partial sale of the stake in TAG, generating more or less a net income very close to the previous cycle of 2023; but of course when you consider the effect of the sale of TAG, our net income reported a 25% increase to R$ 4.3 bi. So, Ebitda contributed with another R$ 100 million.\nAs  we  had  a  series  of  new  projects  going  into  commercial  operation  and  which  were included in our portfolio following the acquisition of certain assets at the beginning of last year, naturally you have a much bigger asset base, naturally coming with a considerable increase in our depreciation and amortization expenses.\nSo, you have an effect between Ebitda and profit which is also greater -to the tune of about R$ 150 million -, while the financial result is basically at the same level as before. Naturally, an important part of the additional financial cost we had was due to the increase in the cost of debt indexed to CDI and IPCA was capitalized … because we have some assets under construction, right? So, part of this additional financial cost was capitalized.\nLet's move onto the next slide now where we talk a little more in detail about our debut in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. For those who don't know, this index is very relevant , because it's a global metric which is based on S&P scores.\nWe have to complete a report known as a Corporate Sustainability Assessment; through this instrument, some 7.7 thousand companies were analyzed, of which 800 were eligible for inclusion in this index and at the end of the day, we were even positively surprised because after all we've done a fantastic job internally over the last few years, both at home - in fact, putting sustainability into practice - and in being able to communicate very precisely what we've been doing in the Company.\nThe result was that we came out as the best-performing company in Brazil in the electricity sector and among the top 6 in the sector worldwide out of 182 companies  which were evaluated. Below there are some indicators in which we are the crème de la crème here in Emerging Markets, and among the top 5% globally in our sector.\nAnother highlight of this ESG slide is that ENGIE features once more in the Corporate Knights Global 100 ranking, now ranked 21st and placed as one of the most sustainable companies in the world; there are only three Brazilian companies, and we are the only company in the electricity sector with its headquarters outside Europe. I'm very proud of this, it's the result of work conducted over a long period and involving a lengthy process of evolution here.",
  "In the next slide, now we talk about indicators. It is a little more quantitative also. Our emissions intensity fell on an annual comparative basis: it is basically half -a little less than half even -compared to 2023.\nRegarding occupational health and safety, despite the series of projects which we have and simultaneous  being  implemented  in  Brazil  with  thousands  of  employees  and  service providers, the number of accidents… our  frequency rate  fell  significantly  in  relation  to 2023, which makes us very proud, because this is considered a pillar of our operation here: namely not to put people at risk, and to anticipate any situation -so as to mitigate -what might cause a more serious outcome to our team.\nIn the upper right-hand corner, we talk about the percentage of women in our labor force and  in  leadership  positions.  We  continue  improving  our  participation  on  a  gradual  and sustainable basis. 32% of our total labor force is now made up of women versus 29.4% in the  previous  year;  and  also,  a  very  significant  increase  here  of  women  in  positions  of leadership, surpassing the 31% mark, almost 4 points above last year.\nIn the lower left-hand chart, we talk about investment in innovation, basically the same level  as  2023.  There  was  a  notable  jump  in  investment  in  social  responsibility,  largely because we had a greater amount of tax incentive resources available associated with the profit on the sale of TAG early last year. Just to mention something important here: not only did we increase this value but also indeed we used 100% of the available tax incentives, a demonstration of the efficiency of our team here in Social Responsibility.\nAnd last but not least, in the last chart, down here on the right hand side, we maintained people of relationship with the community, which we calculate based on the number of engaged people -we  monitor according to the number of engaged people in the area around us.\nIn  the  following  slide,  we  talk  about  operating  highlights  and  show  why  we  had  such considerable growth in total generation between the years. Here, I am going to focus on the bar chart on the left-hand side of the slide of total energy generation and accumulated for 12 months.\nWe show here in the lower part,  dark  blue,  the  hydropower  plants.  There  was  a  very significant increase here. Note that last year was a year when we had a GSF more or less in line with the previous year - we had an average GSF of 0.87, versus the previous year of nearly 0.899% almost. This means that, on average, in Brazil, we generated less than the previous year; but in the South, where we have numerous assets, generation was much higher,  so  there  was  this  imbalance  here  that  permitted  much  higher  hydropower generation than the previous year.\nIn the upper part, we go into a little more detail in the context of wind, SHP, biomass and solar,  which  is  our  generation  from  complementary  sources  and  in  this  slide,  we  show accumulated generation for 12 months where we also saw an advance on various fronts. On the lower part of the bar chart are the operating wind complexes -those that were in operation in 2023 -, where there was a very significant increase in performance thanks to internal improvements in uptime as well as the more efficient management of the assets -more than 10% increase in generation between periods.\nWe also had an increase in generation. Naturally, as we started up a series of projects at Serra do Assuruá, we also had more than 92 average MW which entered the wind power base -we call this ' additional scope ' -, we wanted to open it up to compare both the existing and the additional. Despite the negative impact of curtailment, we had a very significant increase in wind generation in our portfolio.",
  "Biomass was largely static -a little less than in 2023, and this is also envisaged within our model here. And in the case of solar, penalization was greater due to curtailment, starting from 54 average MW and falling to 48 average MW between the periods -an important reduction here, mainly a function of curtailment -, even though we had the entry of new assets coming on stream in our portfolio both by acquisition -via M&A -but also by startup in operations at our greenfield project up there at Assú Sol, which shows how we jumped in  solar  generation  between  periods .  That's to  say,  we  had  a  very  significant  growth: generation  driven  by  complementary  sources,  increasing  nearly  30%  in  relation  to generation the previous year.\nA little more on highlights in the following slide, for curtailment, which has been a very important theme and perhaps one of the most commented on in recent times. On the lefthand  side  of  this  slide,  we  show  in  our  performance,  the  effect  of  curtailment -or constrained-off -for both wind and solar generation.\nThere in the last bar of the charts on the left shows Engie versus the average for the market, the average for Brazil. We had 8% curtailment for wind versus 7% for Brazil: 16% solar curtailment here, versus 15% the average for Brazil. Our footprint is revealed as very similar to the Brazilian blend as a whole.\nWe have assets showing curtailment considerably more than this value, but we also hold assets  with  curtailment  of  much  less  and  resulting  in  our  average  level  of  curtailment matching the national average.\nWhen  you  combine  wind  and  solar,  we  have  a  combined  effect  here  of  9%  of  total curtailment in the year, versus 8% for SIN  - National Interconnected System. Note that although this 9% naturally hurts our wind and solar portfolio, at the end of the day it is quite diluted when seen from the point of view of our total portfolio.\nThis is important because it shows that we are still fully able to pay our debts and absorb this cut. Naturally, we are working to root this out at source, not only through the operator making the operation more efficient through the startup of new transmission lines, but also through more efficient management of assets.\nSo, there are a series of initiatives in progress here but at the end of the day, we continue to experience a very limited impact on our total generation and naturally on our Ebitda and result.\nRafa, can you take over for this next stage?\nRAFAEL BÓSIO: Taka, good morning; and good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover here two sections: commercialization and an update on the projects in implementation, which demonstrate how we are expanding in installed capacity as well as in the transmission sector.\nSo,  beginning  here  with  commercialization,  on  slide  13,  we  show  an  updated  energy balance, which if compared to the one we published in the third quarter, you can identify how we performed in the commercial area -how we contracted the portfolio.\nSo, as is well known in the market, we have a strategy, the central pillar of which is to endeavor to be highly contracted in the short-term so as not to be exposed to prices, to the PLD for the periods; because, OK, the PLD can be high, but it can also be very low, so our objective here is, in a way, to protect the Company's revenues , allowing us to traverse periods  for  example,  of  economic  deceleration,  an  eventual  hydrological  crisis  and multifarious  events  to  which  we  have  been  subject  in  the  past  few  years,  including  a pandemic.  So,  in  short,  we  are protecting  the  Company's  revenue  by  being  highly contracted in the short-term and this is the strategy guiding us.\nAs you can see, it is a fact that in the years 2025 and 2026, we have just a marginal volume of energy for sale -4% in 25 and 7% in 26, uncontracted energy beginning to grow little from 27 onwards. And why should this be? Because also in the case of the free market, consumers don't buy energy so far into the future, four to five years ahead; rather they begin buying energy one and half years or two years before they need to use it.",
  "On the left-hand side is the energy balance. So compared with what we disclosed in the third quarter, you can see that we sold 110 av. MW -we reduced the outstanding of our outstanding balance by 110 average MW from 2025 to 2030 -, -so, yes...with liquidity in the market, we managed to sign contracts in such a way that we haven't experienced any relevant dilution in average price.\nThe right-side, the right-hand side of the chart, shows precisely our sales activity as well as the benefit arising from not being obliged to sell energy. You can see some bars in the chart  from  one  period  to  another,  they … you  accelerate  the  sale  and  reduce  the uncontracted energy, but on other occasions, the bars level out; in other words, we are able  to  choose  the  best  moment  for  contracting  energy  and  are  not  forced  to  sell  our product at a time when perhaps the price is not the ideal according to our vision of things.\nIn the next slide -slide 14, please -, we show our commercialization strategy … how we are approaching the opening of the free market. You can see how we are experiencing vigorous growth in the number of free consumers in our portfolio: more than 28% on average\nsince 2021 -we have gone from 880 to over 1.800 customers in our portfolio.\nYes, there is a decrease in volume, but this was our option in a period when … We went through a very difficult year for hydrology back there in 2021, so we took the decision to adopt  a  more  conservative  positioning  in  our  portfolio,  releasing  less energy  for commercialization, providing greater protection against GSF -leaving a higher GSF margin in these periods.\nAnd now with the entry into operation of new projects -as Takamori has commented and which we shall look at more closely in the next slides -, we are beginning to see now a greater volume of resources allocated for sale; in other words we are beginning to see now an inflection point, and this volume beginning to stabilize and rise with the entry into operation of these projects.\nWe have maintained this... Although there was a drop in our market share compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, we can see that, compared to the third quarter, we have remained stable, which also implies that these new resources are entering our contract portfolio.\nLet's move onto the next section , in slide 16. The first project where we update the status is the Serra do Assuruá Wind Complex. Compared to the third quarter, there was a … We saw an advance in the third quarter of 80%. that's a global physical advance -and  on December 31, we had reached 97%, so the work is virtually finished, right? With 95% of the wind turbines already assembled at the end of 4Q24.\nAnd here we present an update to yesterday. See here how from the end of last year to date,  we  have  put  a  further  30  wind  turbines  into  commercial  operations  while  an additional 21 are fully assembled and are operating on a test basis. So today we have just 3 wind turbines left under construction meaning that we should be 100% operational very soon, in the next few weeks; or at the most in a month, a month and a bit, we should be fully operational at Serra do Assuruá.\nNext slide please. We move on now to the Assú Sol Photovoltaic Complex, a very big job -with almost 900 MW peak installed capacity -which has also advanced, in fact ahead of our schedule: implementation 76% complete; connection work has been totally executed.\nAnd we went into operation on a test basis at the end of 2024; and now at the beginning of 2025, we have 4 of the 5 solar farms which were operating on a test basis, now operating commercially, while a further two have gone into operation on a test basis. So, of the 16, 7 are already in operation -either commercially or on a test basis.\nSo, the forecast remains for 100% operation by the end of this year, but with the possibility of a good surprise. But of course, naturally we are going to leave the market updated in the course of reporting our next results.",
  "Moving  on  now … next  slide,  please? -Moving  on  now  to  the  generation  and  to  the implementation of the transmission projects, the first of them, which is at a more advanced stage,  is  Asa  Branca  Transmissora  de  Energia,  a  project  we  successfully  won  in  the transmission auction back in 2023.\nWe  have  already  begun … we  already  have  all  the  licenses  and  effectively  begun  the construction of the project. The first tower has already been erected, about ten days ago, so that implementation can now effectively begin with the construction of the towers such that we can maintain our forecast of anticipating the COD for this project by at least 24 months prior to the Aneel deadline, which is March 2029.\nSo, everything is on track here as well at Asa Branca, and in the same way in the next project, which is Graúna, a project the concession for which we acquired at an auction held last September. This then is a project at a more incipient stage -the environmental licensing stage -, which should occupy the best part of 2025 so we can begin effective implementation next year, allowing us to comply with Aneel's cutoff date of December 2029. In the case of Asa Branca, the deadline for completion is March 2029. So, two projects which are going to be in operation in the next few years, are both in transmission.\nGoing onto the next slide, which is our traditional slide for the Jirau Hydropower plant. As a reminder for those who haven't been following the company closely - or not for very long - this is a plant in which our controlling shareholder, Engie Brasil Participações, has a 40% stake in the capital and 60% of the energy, and there is a possibility that this project will be transferred to ENGIE Brasil Energia, respecting, of course, a process of transactions with related  parties,  through  a  committee  that  will  be  spearheaded  by  the  Company's independent directors.\nSo, nothing very new here on this slide, just reinforcing that, operationally, the plant is performing  very  well  -  100%  uptime  factor  in  2024  -  and  that  we  are  waiting  for  the controller's decision to transfer this asset.\nMoving on to the last slide in this section, because now we have a summary of what we have in expansion: on the left-hand side, projects under construction in both generation and transmission; on the right-hand side, projects under development, so - just to make it clear  -  these  projects  are  still  on  paper,  they  are  awaiting  an  opportunity  to  be implemented. What opportunity might that be? Commercial conditions - energy prices that\nmake these projects viable in order to deliver the minimum return expected.\nWell, that concludes the slides, so I return the floor to you, Takamori, for the financial performance section.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Thank you. Here we show an evolution in both our ROE as well as our  ROIC.  In  2024,  we  had  a  reduction  in  both  indicators  of  economic  performance; naturally explained by the increase of new money here which naturally has still not been converted into results from these new projects which are going into operation.\nIt is worth remembering also -as Rafa has said -we have a portfolio in construction still. We have both Assuruá as well as Assú Sol being finalized, and under construction during the past year, so you injected important capital there but without as yet generating the corresponding result: and we still have additionally also the transmission projects which are under construction.\nSo, it is only natural to see a reduction in these amounts here. The value was in the region of 35% here in 2023 -of the ROE -and fell to 27%, although it is worth remembering that 27% is a very good number still, much above the average for the market. ROIC is the same thing: it shrank from 20.3% to 17.2% in 2024, but still also very comfortable here, much above the weighted average.",
  "On the right side of the slide, we habitually show the evolution in our Ebitda here, the breakdown of our adjusted Ebitda. We highlight in these pizzas here that a little less than ten years ago we basically had our Ebitda coming from generation and over the years there has been some degree of diversification here, mainly through the stake in TAG -reducing the participation a little in TAG now, which you can see there in the reduction from 14% to 10% in the contribution to adjusted EBITDA - and, on the other hand, a gradual increase in the share of transmission in the segments contributing to Adjusted Ebitda.\nIn the next slide, we breakdown into a little more detail both revenue as well as Ebitda and profit In this slide of net operating revenue here, there was an evolution from R$ 10.7 bi in 2023 to R$ 11.2 bi in 2024, an increase of 4.4%, basically in line with inflation, but with a series of nuances here which we will highlight now.\nFirstly, the important variation of R$ 250 million reflects the indemnity payment of Santo Agostinho, where there was a delay in completing the work, but this to some degree was compensated for in our agreements with suppliers. So, there was this positive effect here of the Santo Agostinho indemnity.\nPrice of sales … price and volume of sales also had a positive impact. As these new projects go into commercial operation, we also improve the performance of the existing fleet. This naturally generates higher net operating revenue.\nOn the other hand, we now begin to feel the downside of no longer having the contribution of Pampa Sul's revenues , included in our portfolio up to the middle of 2023; and, when you compare 2023 and 2024, we still have this effect of Pampa Sul 's contribution in 2 023. In other words, this is a new reality for Engie, no longer having this revenue contributing to our portfolio, so in a way there is a variation of scope here.\nThe fourth item which we highlight here is in relation to the CCEE. That is, we have not transacted this energy bilaterally with the customer; this here was basically the result of very short-term operations conducted across the CCEE and predominantly due to greater hydropower generation, much greater than the previous year.\nThe last element of the generation and commercialization segment shows that naturally we had an increase in revenue here as a function of the remuneration of financial assets.\nIn the next item moving left, we show a reduction in net operating revenue from trading to the tune of R$ 150 million; but of course, in this case, while you had lower revenue from trading, you are also going to see that we had lower expenditure from trading so this value here practically comes out at zero -neither creating nor destroying value for our Ebitda.\nAnd last but not least, we highlight in the transmission segment a very important variation, compared to the preceding year, both with respect to growth in revenue of the assets, but also mainly in relation to the increase in construction revenue. This has a non-cash effect, basically caused by the way transmission concessions are treated in Brazil, generating a contribution to Ebitda even before the commercial operation of the assets begins. But this is an effect which you are fully aware of already.\nNaturally,  the  main  point  here  is  that  we  managed  to  achieve  an  increase  of  4.4%, surpassing R$ 11 billion in net operating revenue.\nIn the next slide, by way of an addendum - a bridge   we show TAG's contribution. TAG's -net  operating  revenue  was  R$  9  billion  in  2024,  and  after  crossing  the  entire  bridge, deducting costs and expenses of the financial result and the payment of taxes, net profit was approximately R$ 4 billion, and with our new stake in TAG, the contribution to our EBITDA is R$ 714 million. We'll take this figure and move on to the next slide, where you will be able to see.\nThis is perhaps our most complex slide, but also perhaps one of the most eagerly awaited; it's a slide that begins with a kind of... as if there are three different brackets.",
  "So, I'm going to start  with the  outside bracket here,  which is  booked corporate Ebitda encompassing all the non-recurring effects and IFRS adjustments. So, we went from R$ 7.3 billion to R$8.7 billion, a very significant variation - of over 20% - here.\nAnd,  when  you  go  to  the  intermediate  brackets,  you  are  excluding  the  non-recurring effects. Basically what you have as relevant here is the effect of the partial divestment of TAG early on last year, so you have to remove this effect of R$ 1.4 billion more or less -R$ 1.3 billion from the Ebitda -, which takes our increase here from R$ 7.27 billion to R$ 7.37 billion - that's R$ 100 million aggregated here -, an increase of 1.3% between the years, which is fantastic considering the overall context both local, and also global which has complicated the lives of all entrepreneurs nationwide.\nNote that here you have a contribution of this bracket here when you examine the adjusted Ebitda of 2024, there are three main components: at the bottom, which is cut through diagonally,  R$  5.7  billion  or  there  abouts,  contribution  of  the  generation  and  trading segment; R$ 714 million of equity income from TAG, which we explained in the preceding slide; and practically R$ 1 billion of contribution from transmission, naturally considering the IFRS effects.\nWhen you … So, to give you a flavor here, we start out at R$ 5.4 billion and reach R$ 5.7 billion  in  generation,  a  more  modest  increase  of  practically  3%;  TAG  produced  a  lower contribution, something in the region of 30% less than 2023, a reflection of our reduced stake  in  the  company;  and  transmission  increasing  from  R$  600  million  to  nearly R$ 1 billion, an increase of nearly 30%.\nWhen we move to the innermost brackets, we go from R$ 7 billion, approximately, to R$ 6.9 billion and from there, the main elements here that added up between periods are operational and commercial performance - basically, it's a combination of price and volume that justifies approximately half of this amount here, this increase of R$370 million.\nPampa, we'll go into its effect a little further on, but then, from our remaining portfolio, we made a very significant contribution and also, naturally, a reduction in Pampa's energy purchases, which also contributes to this figure here.\nIn the second element here - indemnification and renegotiation - we had a comparative base  here  of...  despite  having  the  benefit  of  Santo  Agostinho  in  2024,  we  had  the renegotiation of Estreito in the 2023 base, so these two key elements net out at R$ 135\nmillion.\nAs for the third element here, short-term operations and royalties generated basically from business conducted across the CCEE, of R$ 160 million, approximately, with generation greater in our portfolio, already deducted for royalties which we pay precisely for the hydropower  plants  generating  most,  they  also  pay  a  greater  contribution  of  hydric resources, so it nets out at R$ 110 million.\nAs we said at the beginning, just as there is an effect on net operating revenue, our Ebitda contribution also suffers a little from the sale and exit of our Pampa Sul base, which was in operation until... it was in our portfolio until mid-2023. So, comparatively, you have this reduction here of R$ 162 million.\nIn charges and insurance, as we have more assets, naturally we pay more in charges and insurance; so, it's mechanical , it's automatic that we have this increase in costs. SG&A, also in the same way. We have some services here which grow proportionally with our portfolio.\nRegarding costs, basically, we have a more significant increase in materials and third-party services here, both involving the new complexes as well as in cases of infrastructure and consultancies, so we have here something which is also in large part mechanical. We can also explore this in a little more detail later on.\nFinally, let's look at the transmission segment. When you exclude the accounting effects of  the  transmission  concessions,  you  in  fact  generate  an  increase  in  RAP  itself  of approximately R$ 28 million.",
  "And finally, a reduction in the contribution of TAG, via the equity income result. We started out at nearly R$ 1 billion in 2023 -that light blue color within the innermost bracket, to a figure of R$ 714 million.\nThe outstanding feature of all this is that we had an Ebitda that grew very significantly throughout the year; and, also very importantly, that, even without the effect of TAG, we managed to keep Ebitda at the level of the previous year, which is cause for celebration here.\nOn the next slide, we'll move on to net profit and so, in the same way here, we'll start with the a comparison of net profit between 2023 and 2024: it rose from R$3.4 billion to R$4.3 billion, a very significant increase - practically a 26% increase between periods -; it shows\nthat investment, even in non-core assets, can create a lot of value when we divest and recycle the capital.\nWhen you eliminate this non-recurring effect here, basically the sale of TAG -which is this element of R$ 931 million -, we reported a net income basically at the same level as 2023; and so when you look at the components, you had an increase of Ebitda -which was the previous slide -with an aggregate value of approximately R$ 100 million more than 2023, but more than neutralized, more than reverted by greater depreciation and amortization.\nRemember: we put many assets into commercial operation, both internally here and in the acquisition  of  new  projects  that  had  an  asset  base  that  had  not  yet  been  significantly depreciated, which generated this additional amount of depreciation and amortization of R$147 million.\nThe net financial result, here, was flat - a little more costly than in the previous year -; and Income Tax as well - and Social Contribution on Net income - at the same level as 2023, generating a net profit at the same level as the previous year as well.\nHere, with regard to indebtedness, as we've been saying... - next slide - as we've been saying  in  the  last  few  calls,  naturally,  the  Company  has  leveraged  itself  within  very controlled levels and in a conscious way. The AAA rating helps us to leverage in an efficient and super-competitive manner compared to other players in our segment and also in other markets, other sectors here in Brazil.\nWe increased our leverage between 2023 and 2024 from 2.1x to 2.7x - by 0.6 times - which is quite significant, but compatible with our growth here and our ambition. We went from 2.1x  to  2.7x  net  debt/adjusted  EBITDA  and  also,  in  more  or  less  the  same  proportion, jumped from 2.9x to 3.3x total debt/adjusted EBITDA.\nOur gross debt reached R$ 24.4 billion, more or less R$ 1 billion higher than in Q3 last year - net, right? Because we took on more debt, but we also repaid some of it. In terms of cash and equivalents, we maintained approximately the same level as before, of R$4 billion; and R$357 million in linked deposits, which gives us a net debt of approximately R$20 billion, which is reflected in this 2.7x ratio.\nWe expect this trajectory to continue increasing in the next year at least, because we will continue to have a combination of investments about which we shall have more to say sequentially  but  all  part  of  what  is  expected  and  swept  up  in  our  business  plan,  and maintaining  the  flexibility  in  order  to  keep  both  our  AAA  rating -in  other  words,  an excellent capacity for repaying our financial obligations -and also our competitivity.\nThe  next  slide  here -the  profile  and  breakdown  of  the  debt  -  shows  that  we  have approximately R$ 2.6 billion here for repayment of... debt maturing in 2025, a little less than that in 2026 and between R$ 1.7 billion and R$ 2.2 billion over the following years. Naturally, we're going to evolve this shape of debt maturity over the coming months and years, both by taking on new debt and also by repaying existing debt.",
  "What's worth highlighting in this slide... So, what's worth highlighting is that it's a profile that's very compatible with our cash generation. It's also worth noting that we pay special attention to the composition of our debt. We had a composition that was stronger in IPCA, bordering on 80% - or more - based on IPCA.\nWe did some rebalancing here of our composition shifting a little to CDI, both to diversify the basket of indexers as well as to have a slightly lesser impact in the event of a hike in inflation-linked prices in the short-term, which would reprice and penalize debt in a more significant manner.\nIn this next slide we show the investment plan. Here as you must have noticed, 2024 was a more challenging one from the point of view of financial structure because it is a fact that  we  were  obliged  to  make  this  investment  of  R$ 9.7 billion;  it  is  a  very  significant investment -in various months surpassing R$ 1 billion -, so we had to manage our cash super-efficiently.\nOver these next years -this one and the next few years, we're back a little more to normal. This year, we still have around R$ 4.2 billion in committed capital; basically, half of this is justified  by  Asa  Branca,  which  is  a  transmission  project  for  which  we  obtained  the concession some time ago, already having finalized all the contracts - as Rafael mentioned - and now the actual implementation cycle is starting. And in the years 2026 and 2027, we'll return to this level of R$ 2.1 billion, R$ 2.2 billion, totaling R$ 8 billion, including this year and the next - R$ 8.5 billion over the next three years including this year.\nAs for the dividend policy, which is on the next slide, we always point out that, whenever possible, we raise the payout to 100% - both in 2023 and 2024, we kept this level at 55% and that, even so, even with this reduced payout, which is a commitment of the Board of 55% - we managed a dividend yield of 5.6%.\nRafa, let's finish this part ?\nRAFAEL  BÓSIO: That's  it , let's  go  to  the Q&A.  we  have  some  questions  there,  right, Adriana?\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Now the more entertaining part.\nADRIANA WAGNER: Ok. We are beginning the questions and answers session and to ask a question just send it using the Q&A tool of this video conference.\nOur first question comes from Rafael Oliveira, our investor, and he wants to know about dividends declared and payable, whether there is any idea as to when these will be paid; and as to the payout for 2025, if there is guidance.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: We are going to make an announcement as soon as possible on dates -we still don't have the dates fixed . As to the payout for 2025, naturally we are dependent on the evolution of the market; we know that this year is a year with a lot going on, right? We still have a series of commitments -as I have just shown: R$ 4 billion investments already committed; and naturally, we are always looking for opportunities in the market that may make sense for us.\nSo, it's a bit early to give guidance here both with respect to dates of payments at the moment and also payout. Do you want to say anything, Rafa?\nRAFAEL BÓSIO: Taka, I think what is worth … It is, I think worth emphasizing that we have had this policy of minimum payments of 55% for many years now, for more than a decade -a  question of 15 years … 17 years that we have this policy -,  which has always been respected; and that we consider that even the minimum is a considerable dividend if you look around the market and other companies listed on the Stock Exchange.\nWe are talking about a company that is reporting growth but also does not fail to distribute the value it generates -more than half the value it generates -for its shareholders. So, it's a partnership, right ?\nADRIANA WAGNER: Ok, onto our second question …",
  "EDUARDO TAKAMORI: I think that … just to conclude this point ok, Adri? -This question is good and is a reminder that whenever possible we opt to distribute the maximum. So, if we are retaining some, it is because we really believe that we are going to achieve a bigger return than the cost of shareholder capital.\nSo, this is the point here: we have financial discipline and do not grow in a strategic or random manner only. We do not have a specific growth objective here; indeed, our mission is to grow creating value.\nADRIANA WAGNER: Ok, thank you. Our second question comes from João Pedro Herrero, analyst at Santander, and he would like to know if we can give a little more detail on the costs of materials and third-party services, if we might explain the increase a little better and if we can expect these levels on a recurrent basis.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: So, we had an important variation. And of course there are some effects there. We had the natural effect which is inflation which is not necessarily the IPCA alone.\nAn important contributor is variation of scope -I think that is probably the main element, OK, Pedro? -, we included many new assets. So, we included Serra do Assuruá, Assú Sol… and consequently, the corresponding new regional offices, which we have to structure. And we also included new assets for our portfolio via M&A. So naturally, a significant part of the variation that you must have noticed here   material, was caused by this variation of -scope.\nAdditionally,  we  also  had  some  maintenance  work  on  hydropower  plants,  which  is  not necessarily recurring -so possibly it is going to be just this year or there is a chance that this work may last a little longer -, which also generated this variation a little here: more than R$ 30 million of this variation relates to this maintenance work.\nSo, I would say that R$ 70 million or R$ 80 million relates to the variation in scope; while there  is  another  R$  30  million  dedicated  to  hydropower  plant  maintenance;  and  the remainder split across many items.\nADRIANA WAGNER: Thanks, Taka. The next question comes from Rodrigo Gressler, our investor,  and  he  asks :  ' Given  the  decline  in  average  selling  prices  when  set  against  a scenario of improved hydrology and greater offer of renewables, what are the strategies for renegotiation or adjustment of the energy contracts for improving profitability ?'.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Excellent question. First out, I would just like to comment a little on your comment about the fall in average selling prices. In fact, this is a little…. In fact, there has been a recent change here, with an outlook of … Let me begin again.\nWe  were  forecasting  an  extremely  positive hydrological period driving the price downwards. We experienced hydrology which confirmed this outlook in the early stages of the hydrological period, but now there has been a marked reversal … and it is virtually a consensus that from now on, you are going to have less rain where it is needed most in Brazil -less ZACS the South Atlantic Convergence Zone. This results in you having much less water and this could eventually mean an early end to the rainy season.\nCombined with the fact that our model now -our price formation model -is more risk averse, is dispatching more power from the thermo-electrics, anticipating thermoelectric dispatch which normally occurs in the second half of the year to the first half and in doing so, you tend to generate some very interesting prices, OK?\nSo, our outlook until the end of last year, of a price -in line with what you are saying -a little lower, but the market has already reacted more recently, so much so that prices are rising, and rising significantly, right? In fact, it is the moment perhaps for those who are uncontracted to lengthen their contracts now in 2026, 2027, 2028. We of course are at the other extreme.\nBut note that, besides the increase in average price, you have much greater volatility now going forward due to the model's greater aversion to risk and greater volatility now from the  greater  impact  of  affluence  combined  with  our  energy  matrix,  now  also  strongly dependent on wind and solar resources.",
  "So, it has been much more difficult to predict prices. The prices are on average higher -not lower -now in the short-term, and this in fact is affecting, the market dynamic.\nNow, about the strategic question here, where you ask about renegotiation or adjusting energy contracts. We honor our contracts, neither renegotiating nor adjusting them, OK? We seek to improve the profitability upfront, contracting well when we consider prices are favorable to the generator, but we honor our agreements, so I don't know if this applies in the context of this question you raise of renegotiating or adjusting contracts, OK?\nWhat we always do is to maintain close contact with our customer base as far as is possible, extending the contracts which make sense both to us as well as to our customer base.\nRAFAEL BÓSIO: I think it is worth just to point out, to observe that we are highly contracted in the short-term as I commented this is our strategy. So, this volatility -lower price this year, higher price -, it impacts just a small part of our portfolio.\nWhat is more important for us is the reflection of this volatility on the long-term average energy price and this we endeavor to capture up front -this reflection -, whether to take the decision to sell more or sell less -right Taka? -; I think this is important to underscore.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: It is, and just since the beginning of the year, prices for next year, prices for 2026, have already jumped from R$ 170 to R$ 200 -they exceeded R$ 200 this week -, so, clearly this has a strong impact on the short-term; but as Rafa has said, as we are extremely well contracted, we are very well protected. We are capturing value now\nwith the extensions of the contracts, because of course, the prices for 2027 and 2028 have begun to increase as well. So, we monitor this very closely so that we maximize the value of our portfolio also.\nADRIANA WAGNER: Thanks,  Taka.  Continuing  with  the  questions,  the  next  one  is  from Daniel Travitzky, analyst at Safra, and he has two questions. The first is : ' How are you managing to navigate the high price volatility scenario? And how is market liquidity ?'; and the  second :  'What  is  the  Company's  vision  on  expansion  of  investments  in  renewable energy  projects  at  this  time,  considering  the  context  of  the  segment,  which  is  being impacted by curtailment, energy prices and implementation costs of new projects ?'.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Ok,  good  questions.  The  first  was  partly  answered  by  our  sales strategy already described. I indicated just now that indeed we are monitoring this increase in  short-term prices; we have already established a strategy for maintaining very little short-term  energy.  Naturally, we're  talking about  very  little  energy  in  the  short-term considering that we have a hydropower reserve -a strategic reserve here -to cope with scenarios  of  less  water,  unfavorable  hydrology.  So,  we  are  relatively  protected  and monitoring the market to identify good selling opportunities.\nLiquidity appears to be active. There was some loss of liquidity at the end of the year due to stress with the traders, but it seems that market stability to some degree has been restored,  naturally  with  more  discretion  when  executing  counterparty  agreements, naturally exerting greater care with counterparties when finalizing contracts.\nRegarding  your  second  question  on  the  expansion  of  investment  in  renewable  energy projects, we continue to monitor the market, but naturally we view with some caution the idea of putting money into new greenfield projects if only because it is difficult to forecast medium- to long-term prices at present.\nSo, what we have today is a well-designed portfolio, already contracted at levels that are well  suited  to  the  short-  and  medium-term  horizon,  which  gives  us  the  opportunity  to manage the portfolio well and allows us to move, to sell energy, only when we need to or when we're interested.",
  "When you design a new renewable energy project - which in fact are the most competitive sources from the point of view of cost of... of LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) - we end up being a little cautious about embarking on new projects at this time, mainly because of the unpredictability of revenue, and not because of construction capacity. So, what we've been  doing  here  is  monitoring  the  market,  checking  for  projects  that  may  be  well contracted and that make sense for in-housing.\nBut -I think as a summary of my discussion here -we monitor the market; we have a pipeline, but we have no interest in going for a new greenfield project for the time being; we monitor the market in search of projects that are well contracted and are well-built, and where we would be able to continue creating value here, right?\nADRIANA WAGNER: Thanks, Taka. Moving on here to the next question which is from Juan Aquino. He asks us : 'What is the Company's expectation as to the efficiency of CAPEX and the anticipation forecast for the transmission block which the Company bid successfully in 2024, that is Graúna?'.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Ok.  Significant  anticipation  is  expected  for  Graúna,  and  we  are confident that we are going to be able to deliver this anticipation -you will be able to see this from the next few reports. Rafa can eventually make some additional remarks, but we habitually do not give precise dates of anticipation, because this is a touch strategic here; but we are very comfortable about being able to deliver considerably ahead of schedule.\nAnd as far as CAPEX efficiency is concerned, in general it's not an element from which we can squeeze much in relation to what has been projected by the regulator, by Aneel. In general, our strategy here is to optimize, yes, but we really value having good partners so that we don't incur any extra costs during construction. So, we make pre-contracts, we have  good  negotiations  and  topflight  partners  to  achieve  smooth  execution.  Our  track record  has  always  been  in  this  direction  and  has  worked  well.  We  manage  to  gain competitiveness in other elements.\nRAFAEL BÓSIO: I think it is also important to emphasize -right, Taka? -that we are also going to have very significant synergies in this project with a project which we have already in operation, which is Gralha Azul; so, we also think that this is going to create relevant value in the development of the project.\nADRIANA WAGNER: Our next question comes from Jun Young, a buyside analyst at Prumo, and he would like … if we could comment on the outlook for curtailment during the year, discussions and legal processes involving reimbursement and what ENGIE 's contributions are on the matter.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Ok. Our expectation of curtailment for the year is very much in line with last year. Structurally, physically, there is no reason for it to be any different: you have some very modest additions to transmission -there is nothing relevant on the radar here -; on the other hand, you continue having important growth in supply, compensated by demand, although we are going to continue seeing that level of 10% average for the year, it should be about that. I wouldn't put it very different ly from this in the projection.\nOf  course,  you  have  a  very  large,  very  heterogeneous  stratification,  depending  on  the portfolio  you're  looking  at,  both  in  terms  of  wind  and  solar  sources  and  geographical location, proximity to bottlenecks...\nSo it depends a lot on the portfolio, but we imagine that 2025 will be very similar to 2024 and that things will eventually get a little worse until 2028, when the main transmission lines  come  on  stream  allowing  this  energy  -  large  blocks  of  energy  -  to  flow  from  the generation area in the Northeast to the consumption hub in the Center-Southeast-South.\nThere was another part to the question which was … What was it?\nADRIANA WAGNER: Let me get back to it here; just a minute. It was about the agendas for reimbursement.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Ah, the legal processes! I remembered the legal processes.\nADRIANA WAGNER:",
  "T hat's it .\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: It  is  our  understanding that there are various different elements here. The first of them … perhaps the main one is the slight aversion to risk demonstrated by the operator of the system operating the network. Without going into the merit of the reasons, the fact is that this aversion to risk of the operator ends up resulting in limitations with  respect  to  the  use  of  transmission  lines  and  this  increases  curtailment  very significantly.\nSo, we understand that this element of the operator's greater aversion to risk as well as the eventual delay in planning and implementation of transmission lines should be borne by the end consumer, because this is indeed… these are indeed, unpredictable elem ents for any entrepreneur in the sector, of the segment. This I think is the principal element. Can we perhaps move on to the next slide?\nADRIANA WAGNER: Ok,  thank you. Now onto our next question which comes from two investors, Hebert de Oliveira and Waldyr Passetto Junior, about TAG. I am going to join the two questions because they are correlated. The first one: do we consider the partial sale of TAG as positive, given that it is still contributing good profits to the Company with a reduced  stake  and  what  is  the  progress  of  the  new  investments  which  are  using  the resources raised from TAG; and, complementary to this, why the gain from the sale will not be distributed in the form of dividends.\nEDUARDO  TAKAMORI: As  you  must  have  noticed,  we  had  in  2024  a  year  of  record investment at ENGIE Brasil Energia -close to R$ 10 billion -; and, naturally when CDPQ contacted us at the end of 2023, we saw that partial divestment could make sense for satisfying our 2024 CAPEX requirements.\nSo, when we took the decision to go for this partial divestment, naturally the corresponding resources were allocated not only to the projects under construction of Assuruá and Assú Sol but also the conclusion of Santo Agostinho and the entire new portfolio in the process of being installed.\nAnd these investments, of course, had already been... there had already been cycles of decision making over the last few years with respect to investments, so we didn't take the profit from the sale of TAG and say 'what are we going to do? What new project are we going to implement?'; no, the TAG resource is part of a larger CAPEX financing equation for 2024. We also went to the market several times for infrastructure debentures, other lines with development banks, so it was all part of the same equation.\nThis connects with Waldyr's next question, why wasn't it distributed: precisely because it is an  element  that  is  naturally  non-recurring;  and  if  we  distributed  TAG's  profit proportionally, the effect of TAG's sale would also be diluted. In fact, we used this money - the entire amount we obtained from the sale, excluding taxes here - which was something around R$ 2.5 billion, to incorporate in this financing equation here for our CAPEX of R$10 billion last year.\nRAFAEL BÓSIO: Just to address the last question of Hebert, which is ' what is the progress of the new investments which are using the resources raised from TAG ?', it is precisely that which we covered in the presentation and on which Takamori commented: we are seeing  the  benefits  from  the  anticipated  entry  into  operation  of  Serra do  Assuruá;  the acquisition of the Atlas assets, the solar energy assets; the entry into operation of Assú Sol … So, for example, this quarter we saw a reduction in the need to purchase energy from third parties; so, all this represents the creation of value from these new investments now materializing.\nWe know that the implementation of a new project takes from 2 to 3 years, during which in the first moments, we bear the weight of the debt for the funding required to get this project off the ground. And when the project goes into operation, you start deleveraging, start generating the expected value from the new assets.\nLet's go to the next one , Adri.",
  "ADRIANA WAGNER: Continuing with the question now from Williney Silva and he would like to know whether the Company foresees leverage exceeding or equaling 3x net debt/Ebitda with the increase in interest rates and if this could impact the Company.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Ok, good question. Our plan is always to guarantee our AAA-Fitch rating. Naturally, Fitch bases its rating on the agency's very strict criteria, a maximum leverage of 3.5x net debt/Ebitda. So, naturally, this is very dear to us. But we could go up to this level. At the moment, we don't see it reaching as high as 3.5x, but naturally it's a ceiling for leverage.\nNaturally, over the course of this cycle, we are going to raise more debt, so our leverage, currently at 2.7x, should exceed the 3x mark; it should go above during the year, as already mentioned, more towards the end of the first half perhaps. But this is included in our plans and is expected.\nThis is  also  a  way  of  balancing:  in  order to continue paying 55% dividends, we have to exceed  3x  net  debt/Ebitda.  But  this,  of  course,  doesn't  compromise  any  of  our  strict covenants, such as 4.5x total debt/Ebitda and service, so we don't see a problem. Naturally, we suffer a little from the increase in interest rates, inflation, CDI and Selic, but all within expectations - it's all part of the game.\nADRIANA  WAGNER: Thank  you,  Taka.  We  are  out  of  time.  We  received  some  further questions, which will be addressed here by the IR area directly to participants. We would like to thank the participation of everyone, and I now give the floor to Taka and Rafael for their final considerations.\nEDUARDO TAKAMORI: Perfect. It's a pleasure to welcome all of you to our call, and it's with great satisfaction that we close a year that has been so challenging but also very rewarding, with new projects coming on stream and much more to come - Rafa.\nRAFAEL BÓSIO : Well, everyone, thank you. As Adriana said, we're here to help. You can count on ENGIE's IR department; if you have any questions or need further clarification, please just contact us.\nThanks - right, Takamori? - and see you next time.\nADRIANA WAGNER : The ENGIE Brasil Energia videoconference is now closed.
