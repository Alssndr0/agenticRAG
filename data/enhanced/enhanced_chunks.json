    "text": "Tue 04 Feb, 2025 - 4:07 PM ET\nFitch Ratings - Rio de Janeiro - 04 Feb 2025: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Engie Brasil Energia S.A.'s (Engie Brasil) Foreign Currency (FC) and Local Currency (LC) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BB+' and 'BBB-', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed Engie Brasil's Long-Term National Scale Rating and its senior unsecured debenture issuances at 'AAA(bra)'. The Rating Outlook for corporate ratings is Stable.\nEngie Brasil's ratings reflect its prominent market position as the second-largest electric energy generation company in Brazil, with a sizable, diversified asset base and operational efficiency. The company's credit profile also benefits from a track record of robust operating cash flow generation and a solid financial profile, with moderate leverage and strong financial flexibility.\nFitch believes Engie Brasil is prepared to manage its high capex plan, despite the challenges from expected lower prices for its uncontracted energy in the coming years. Engie Brasil's FC IDR is constrained by Brazil's Country Ceiling of 'BB+', while Brazil's operating environment anchors the LC IDR. Robust Business Profile: Engie Brasil's ratings benefit from a strong business position in the electric power generation segment in Brazil. It is the second-largest energy generation company in the country, with a total installed capacity of 9.3 GW, to be expanded to 10.7GW in 2025 with the conclusion of new projects. The company has a successful track record in its commercial strategy and monthly allocation of assured capacity. It also benefits from the diluted operational risks due to its diversified asset base.\nThe transmission segment provides further diversification and improves predictability to operating cash flow. Engie Brasil has 2,710 km of transmission lines in operation and 1,780 km under development, to be concluded by 2029. Permitted annual revenues of BRL771 million in this segment should represent roughly 10% of consolidated EBITDA in 2025.\nHigh Capex Pressures FCF: The base case scenario for the ratings considers high investments of BRL8.3 billion, mainly concentrated in 2025, and strong dividend distribution, which will pressure Engie Brasil's FCF. Fitch estimates EBITDA of BRL6.9 billion in 2025 and BRL7.0 billion in 2026, and cash flow from operations (CFFO) of BRL4.1 billion in 2025 and BRL4.0 billion in 2026, with negative FCF of BRL1.9 billion in 2025 and positive FCF of BRL190 million in 2026. Fitch expects the EBITDA margin to increase over the next few years, reaching 65% in 2025, due to reduced energy purchase expenses with the new generation projects conclusion. The base case scenario anticipates sales of 4.7 average GW (aGW) in 2025 and 4.8 aGW in 2026, with average tariffs of BRL232/MWh and BRL226/MWh, respectively.\nLeverage Expected to Peak in 2025: Fitch estimates Engie Brasil's net leverage ratio will reach 3.2x in 2025, up from 2.3x in 2023 and an expected 3.0x in 2024. These ratios remain consistent with the current LC IDR. A reduction in dividends received from Transportadora Associada de GÃ¡s S.A. (TAG) to roughly BRL151 million in 2025 from BRL583 million in 2024 will negatively affect leverage ratios in 2025.\nThe net debt-to-EBITDA ratio should begin to approach 3.0x from 2026 onward. The company has a positive track record in capital structure management, which has included reducing dividend distribution in the past.",

    "text": "Manageable Hydrologic and Curtailment Risks: Fitch estimates Engie Brasil's uncontracted energy volumes of 16% in 2025 and 19% in 2026 would be sufficient to support the expected generating scaling factor (GSF) of 0.89 and 0.91 in the same years, respectively. If needed, Engie Brasil has to obtain energy purchase contracts at prices compatible with those established in sales contracts to cover the reduction in its own generation to avoid higher negative impacts on cash generation.\nThe company has protection against hydrological risk in contracts in the regulated market, which represents approximately 35% of the energy sold and limits its assured energy exposure to GSF to 31%. A diversified asset base also mitigates curtailment impact, with 10% constrained off in renewables plants considered manageable for the group.\nExposure to Repricing and Concession Risk in the Medium Term: Engie Brasil's uncontracted position above 35% from 2028 onward represents a pricing risk in the medium term. The base case scenario for the ratings incorporates average prices of BRL210/MWh for new contracts from 2028 onward, less than BRL256/MWh for the current contracts.\nIn addition, important concessions, which totals 3.9GW and represents 43% of the company current installed capacity, expire during 2030-2032. Fitch believes the group still has time to manage these exposures and expects potential impacts in the cash flow, capital structure or liquidity position to be addressed in advance. Weak Parent-Subsidiary Linkage: Engie Brasil's ratings are based on its Standalone Credit Profile, as legal, operational and strategic incentives for parent company Engie S.A. (Engie, BBB+/Stable) to support the Brazilian subsidiary, if needed, are weak. Engie controls 68.71% of Engie Brasil, but there are no guarantees or cross-default clauses.\nStrategic incentives of support are low as Engie Brasil represents less than 10% of the group's EBITDA despite being the largest market outside Europe and having some growth potential. Fitch views operational incentives as low to medium, with some reputational risks related to the use of a common name.",

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:\n-- Negative rating action for the LC IDR would be associated with a deterioration in Engie Brasil's consolidated financial profile, with net adjusted leverage above 3.5x and/or funds from operations net leverage of more than 4.0x, both on a sustained basis;\n-- A downgrade on Brazil's sovereign rating would result in a similar rating action on Engie Brasil's FC IDR;\n-- A weaker operating environment in Brazil could result in a downgrade of the LC IDR;\n-- A two-notch downgrade of Engie Brasil's LC IDR may lead to a downgrade of the National Scale Rating. -- Positive rating action for the company's FC IDR would be associated with an upgrade of Brazil's sovereign rating;\n-- Positive rating action for the company's LC IDR would be associated with improvements in Brazil's operating environment;\n-- Upgrades are not applicable to the National Scale Rating, as it is at the highest level. Engie Brasil has ample access to funding sources and a strong liquidity profile, with robust cash position and no short-term debt concentration. As of Sept, 2024, cash and marketable securities of BRL4.0 billion, net of restricted cash of BRL384 million, were strong enough to cover the short-term debt of BRL2.8 billion. The high cash balance, reinforced by capex financing, will be partially used to fund the negative FCF in 2025.\nThe Asa Branca and Grauna project will require capex of BRL3.8 billion in 2025 and 2026, mostly supported by long-term project finance debt at the holding Engie Brasil level. The BRL1.5 billion debentures raised in October 2024 due in 2030 will be mainly used for capex. As of Sept. 2024, Engie Brasil's total debt of BRL24.0 billion was mainly comprised of Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento EconÃ´nico e Social (BNDES) (BRL10.8 billion) and debentures (BRL9.0 billion). Engie Brasil is the second-largest energy generator in Brazil, with a total operational installed capacity of 9.3GW and 1.4GW under development. The company also has 2,710 km of transmission lines in operation and 1,780 km in the pre-operational phase.",

The document highlights Engie Brasil's strong market position as Brazil's second-largest energy producer, its operational efficiency, and its financial stability amidst high capital expenditure pressures. It discusses forecasted EBITDA, cash flow, leverage, and risks linked to uncontracted energy volumes and expiring concessions, while emphasizing the weak linkage with its parent company, Engie S.A.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any thirdparty verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

Fitch Ratings makes routine, commonly-accepted adjustments to reported financial data in accordance with the relevant criteria and/or industry standards to provide financial metric consistency for entities in the same sector or asset class.\nThe complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from ' AAA' to 'D'.Â Fitch also provides information on best-case rating upgrade scenarios and worst-case rating downgrade scenarios (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in each direction) for international credit ratings, based on historical performance. A simple average across asset classes presents best-case upgrades of 4 notches and worst-case downgrades of 8 notches at the 99th percentile.Â For more details on sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, please see Best- and Worst-Case Measures under the Rating Performance page on Fitch's website. The information in this report is provided 'as is' without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will",
