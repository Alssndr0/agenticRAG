[{"idx": 0, "text": "Tue 04 Feb, 2025 - 4:07 PM ET\nFitch Ratings - Rio de Janeiro - 04 Feb 2025: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Engie Brasil Energia S.A.'s (Engie Brasil) Foreign Currency (FC) and Local Currency (LC) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BB+' and 'BBB-', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed Engie Brasil's Long-Term National Scale Rating and its senior unsecured debenture issuances at 'AAA(bra)'. The Rating Outlook for corporate ratings is Stable.\nEngie Brasil's ratings reflect its prominent market position as the second-largest electric energy generation company in Brazil, with a sizable, diversified asset base and operational efficiency. The company's credit profile also benefits from a track record of robust operating cash flow generation and a solid financial profile, with moderate leverage and strong financial flexibility.\nFitch believes Engie Brasil is prepared to manage its high capex plan, despite the challenges from expected lower prices for its uncontracted energy in the coming years. Engie Brasil's FC IDR is constrained by Brazil's Country Ceiling of 'BB+', while Brazil's operating environment anchors the LC IDR. Robust Business Profile: Engie Brasil's ratings benefit from a strong business position in the electric power generation segment in Brazil. It is the second-largest energy generation company in the country, with a total installed capacity of 9.3 GW, to be expanded to 10.7GW in 2025 with the conclusion of new projects. The company has a successful track record in its commercial strategy and monthly allocation of assured capacity. It also benefits from the diluted operational risks due to its diversified asset base.\nThe transmission segment provides further diversification and improves predictability to operating cash flow. Engie Brasil has 2,710 km of transmission lines in operation and 1,780 km under development, to be concluded by 2029. Permitted annual revenues of BRL771 million in this segment should represent roughly 10% of consolidated EBITDA in 2025.\nHigh Capex Pressures FCF: The base case scenario for the ratings considers high investments of BRL8.3 billion, mainly concentrated in 2025, and strong dividend distribution, which will pressure Engie Brasil's FCF. Fitch estimates EBITDA of BRL6.9 billion in 2025 and BRL7.0 billion in 2026, and cash flow from operations (CFFO) of BRL4.1 billion in 2025 and BRL4.0 billion in 2026, with negative FCF of BRL1.9 billion in 2025 and positive FCF of BRL190 million in 2026. Fitch expects the EBITDA margin to increase over the next few years, reaching 65% in 2025, due to reduced energy purchase expenses with the new generation projects conclusion. The base case scenario anticipates sales of 4.7 average GW (aGW) in 2025 and 4.8 aGW in 2026, with average tariffs of BRL232/MWh and BRL226/MWh, respectively.\nLeverage Expected to Peak in 2025: Fitch estimates Engie Brasil's net leverage ratio will reach 3.2x in 2025, up from 2.3x in 2023 and an expected 3.0x in 2024. These ratios remain consistent with the current LC IDR. A reduction in dividends received from Transportadora Associada de G\u00e1s S.A. (TAG) to roughly BRL151 million in 2025 from BRL583 million in 2024 will negatively affect leverage ratios in 2025.\nThe net debt-to-EBITDA ratio should begin to approach 3.0x from 2026 onward. The company has a positive track record in capital structure management, which has included reducing dividend distribution in the past.", "metadata": {"page_mappings": {"bounding_boxes_page_map": {"0": 1, "1": 1, "2": 1, "3": 1, "4": 1, "5": 1, "6": 1, "7": 1, "8": 2, "9": 1}, "charspans_page_map": {"0": 1, "1": 1, "2": 1, "3": 1, "4": 1, "5": 1, "6": 1, "7": 1, "8": 2, "9": 1}}, "filename": ["Fitch Rating.pdf"], "pages": [1, 2], "headings": ["Fitch Affirms Engie Brasil's Ratings; Outlook Stable", "KEY RATING DRIVERS"], "chunk_summary": "This chunk details Fitch Ratings' affirmation of Engie Brasil Energia S.A.'s credit ratings, highlighting its strong market position in Brazil's energy sector, operational efficiency, and financial stability amidst high capital expenditure.

If needed, Engie Brasil has to obtain energy purchase contracts at prices compatible with those established in sales contracts to cover the reduction in its own generation to avoid higher negative impacts on cash generation.\nThe company has protection against hydrological risk in contracts in the regulated market, which represents approximately 35% of the energy sold and limits its assured energy exposure to GSF to 31%. A diversified asset base also mitigates curtailment impact, with 10% constrained off in renewables plants considered manageable for the group.\nExposure to Repricing and Concession Risk in the Medium Term: Engie Brasil's uncontracted position above 35% from 2028 onward represents a pricing risk in the medium term. The base case scenario for the ratings incorporates average prices of BRL210/MWh for new contracts from 2028 onward, less than BRL256/MWh for the current contracts.\nIn addition, important concessions, which totals 3.9GW and represents 43% of the company current installed capacity, expire during 2030-2032. Fitch believes the group still has time to manage these exposures and expects potential impacts in the cash flow, capital structure or liquidity position to be addressed in advance. Weak Parent-Subsidiary Linkage: Engie Brasil's ratings are based on its Standalone Credit Profile, as legal, operational and strategic incentives for parent company Engie S.A. (Engie, BBB+/Stable) to support the Brazilian subsidiary, if needed, are weak. Engie controls 68.71% of Engie Brasil, but there are no guarantees or cross-default clauses.\nStrategic incentives of support are low as Engie Brasil represents less than 10% of the group's EBITDA despite being the largest market outside Europe and having some growth potential.
